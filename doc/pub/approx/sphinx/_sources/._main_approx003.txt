Approximation of functions
==========================

.. index::
   single: approximation; of functions

Let :math:`V` be a function space spanned by a set of *basis functions*
:math:`{\psi}_0,\ldots,{\psi}_N`,

.. math::
         V = \hbox{span}\,\{{\psi}_0,\ldots,{\psi}_N\},

such that any function :math:`u\in V` can be written as a linear
combination of the basis functions:

.. _Eq:fem:approx:ufem:

.. math::
   :label: fem:approx:ufem
        
        u = \sum_{j\in{\mathcal{I}_s}} c_j{\psi}_j{\thinspace .}
        
        

The index set :math:`{\mathcal{I}_s}` is defined as :math:`{\mathcal{I}_s} =\{0,\ldots,N\}` and is
from now on used
both for compact notation and for flexibility in the numbering of
elements in sequences.

For now, in this introduction, we shall look at functions of a
single variable :math:`x`:
:math:`u=u(x)`, :math:`{\psi}_j={\psi}_j(x)`, :math:`j\in{\mathcal{I}_s}`. Later, we will almost
trivially extend the mathematical details
to functions of two- or three-dimensional physical spaces.
The approximation :eq:`fem:approx:ufem` is typically used
to discretize a problem in space. Other methods, most notably
finite differences, are common for time discretization, although the
form :eq:`fem:approx:ufem` can be used in time as well.

.. _fem:approx:LS:

The least squares method  (3)
-----------------------------

Given a function :math:`f(x)`, how can we determine its best approximation
:math:`u(x)\in V`? A natural starting point is to apply the same reasoning
as we did for vectors in the section :ref:`fem:approx:vec:Np1dim`. That is,
we minimize the distance between :math:`u` and :math:`f`. However, this requires
a norm for measuring distances, and a norm is most conveniently
defined through an
inner product. Viewing a function as a vector of infinitely
many point values, one for each value of :math:`x`, the inner product of
two arbitrary functions :math:`f(x)` and :math:`g(x)` could
intuitively be defined as the usual summation of
pairwise "components" (values), with summation replaced by integration:

.. math::
        
        (f,g) = \int f(x)g(x)\, {\, \mathrm{d}x}
        {\thinspace .}
        

To fix the integration domain, we let :math:`f(x)` and :math:`{\psi}_i(x)`
be defined for a domain :math:`\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}`.
The inner product of two functions :math:`f(x)` and :math:`g(x)` is then

.. _Eq:fem:approx:LS:innerprod:

.. math::
   :label: fem:approx:LS:innerprod
        
        (f,g) = \int_\Omega f(x)g(x)\, {\, \mathrm{d}x}
        
        {\thinspace .}
        

The distance between :math:`f` and any function :math:`u\in V` is simply
:math:`f-u`, and the squared norm of this distance is

.. _Eq:fem:approx:LS:E:

.. math::
   :label: fem:approx:LS:E
        
        E = (f(x)-\sum_{j\in{\mathcal{I}_s}} c_j{\psi}_j(x), f(x)-\sum_{j\in{\mathcal{I}_s}} c_j{\psi}_j(x)){\thinspace .}
        
        

Note the analogy with :ref:`(3.9) <Eq:fem:vec:genE>`: the given function
:math:`f` plays the role of the given vector :math:`\boldsymbol{f}`, and the basis function
:math:`{\psi}_i` plays the role of the basis vector :math:`\boldsymbol{\psi}_i`.
We can rewrite :eq:`fem:approx:LS:E`,
through similar steps as used for the result
:ref:`(3.9) <Eq:fem:vec:genE>`, leading to

.. math::
        
        E(c_i, \ldots, c_N) = (f,f) -2\sum_{j\in{\mathcal{I}_s}} c_j(f,{\psi}_i)
        + \sum_{p\in{\mathcal{I}_s}}\sum_{q\in{\mathcal{I}_s}} c_pc_q({\psi}_p,{\psi}_q){\thinspace .}  

Minimizing this function of :math:`N+1` scalar variables
:math:`\left\{ {c}_i \right\}_{i\in{\mathcal{I}_s}}`, requires differentiation
with respect to :math:`c_i`, for all :math:`i\in{\mathcal{I}_s}`. The resulting
equations are very similar to those we had in the vector case,
and we hence end up with a
linear system of the form :ref:`(3.10) <Eq:fem:approx:vec:Np1dim:eqsys>`, with
basically the same expressions:

.. _Eq:fem:approx:Aij:

.. math::
   :label: fem:approx:Aij
        
        A_{i,j} = ({\psi}_i,{\psi}_j),
        
        

.. _Eq:fem:approx:bi:

.. math::
   :label: fem:approx:bi
          
        b_i = (f,{\psi}_i){\thinspace .}
        
        

The projection (or Galerkin) method
-----------------------------------

.. index::
   single: Galerkin method; functions

.. index::
   single: projection; functions

As in the section :ref:`fem:approx:vec:Np1dim`, the minimization of :math:`(e,e)`
is equivalent to

.. _Eq:fem:approx:Galerkin:

.. math::
   :label: fem:approx:Galerkin
        
        (e,v)=0,\quad\forall v\in V{\thinspace .}
        
        

This is known as a projection of a function :math:`f` onto the subspace :math:`V`.
We may also call it a Galerkin method for approximating functions.
Using the same reasoning as
in
:ref:`(3.11) <Eq:fem:approx:vec:Np1dim:Galerkin>`-:ref:`(3.12) <Eq:fem:approx:vec:Np1dim:Galerkin0>`,
it follows that :eq:`fem:approx:Galerkin` is equivalent to

.. _Eq:fem:approx:Galerkin0:

.. math::
   :label: fem:approx:Galerkin0
        
        (e,{\psi}_i)=0,\quad i\in{\mathcal{I}_s}{\thinspace .}
        
        

Inserting :math:`e=f-u` in this equation and ordering terms, as in the
multi-dimensional vector case, we end up with a linear
system with a coefficient matrix :eq:`fem:approx:Aij` and
right-hand side vector :eq:`fem:approx:bi`.

Whether we work with vectors in the plane, general vectors, or
functions in function spaces, the least squares principle and
the projection or Galerkin method are equivalent.

.. _fem:approx:global:linear:

Example: linear approximation
-----------------------------

Let us apply the theory in the previous section to a simple problem:
given a parabola :math:`f(x)=10(x-1)^2-1` for :math:`x\in\Omega=[1,2]`, find
the best approximation :math:`u(x)` in the space of all linear functions:

.. math::
         V = \hbox{span}\,\{1, x\}{\thinspace .}  

With our notation, :math:`{\psi}_0(x)=1`, :math:`{\psi}_1(x)=x`, and :math:`N=1`.
We seek

.. math::
         u=c_0{\psi}_0(x) + c_1{\psi}_1(x) = c_0 + c_1x,

where
:math:`c_0` and :math:`c_1` are found by solving a :math:`2\times 2` the linear system.
The coefficient matrix has elements

.. math::
        
        A_{0,0} = ({\psi}_0,{\psi}_0) = \int_1^21\cdot 1\, {\, \mathrm{d}x} = 1,
        

.. math::
          
        A_{0,1} = ({\psi}_0,{\psi}_1) = \int_1^2 1\cdot x\, {\, \mathrm{d}x} = 3/2,
        

.. math::
          
        A_{1,0} = A_{0,1} = 3/2,
        

.. math::
          
        A_{1,1} = ({\psi}_1,{\psi}_1) = \int_1^2 x\cdot x\,{\, \mathrm{d}x} = 7/3{\thinspace .}  

The corresponding right-hand side is

.. math::
        
        b_1 = (f,{\psi}_0) = \int_1^2 (10(x-1)^2 - 1)\cdot 1 \, {\, \mathrm{d}x} = 7/3,
        

.. math::
          
        b_2 = (f,{\psi}_1) = \int_1^2 (10(x-1)^2 - 1)\cdot x\, {\, \mathrm{d}x} = 13/3{\thinspace .}  

Solving the linear system results in

.. math::
        
        c_0 = -38/3,\quad c_1 = 10,
        

and consequently

.. math::
        
        u(x) = 10x - \frac{38}{3}{\thinspace .}

Implementation of the least squares method
------------------------------------------

Symbolic integration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The linear system can be computed either symbolically or
numerically (a numerical integration rule is needed in the latter case).
Let us first compute the system and its solution symbolically, i.e.,
using classical "pen and paper" mathematics with symbols.
The Python package ``sympy`` can greatly help with this type of
mathematics, and will therefore be frequently used in this text.
Some basic familiarity with ``sympy`` is assumed, typically
``symbols``, ``integrate``, ``diff``, ``expand``, and ``simplify``. Much can be learned
by studying the many applications of ``sympy`` that will be presented.

Below is a function for symbolic computation of the linear system,
where :math:`f(x)` is given as a ``sympy`` expression ``f`` involving
the symbol ``x``, ``psi`` is a list of expressions for :math:`\left\{ {{\psi}}_i \right\}_{i\in{\mathcal{I}_s}}`,
and ``Omega`` is a 2-tuple/list holding the limits of the domain :math:`\Omega`:

.. code-block:: python

        import sympy as sym
        
        def least_squares(f, psi, Omega):
            N = len(psi) - 1
            A = sym.zeros((N+1, N+1))
            b = sym.zeros((N+1, 1))
            x = sym.Symbol('x')
            for i in range(N+1):
                for j in range(i, N+1):
                    A[i,j] = sym.integrate(psi[i]*psi[j],
                                          (x, Omega[0], Omega[1]))
                    A[j,i] = A[i,j]
                b[i,0] = sym.integrate(psi[i]*f, (x, Omega[0], Omega[1]))
            c = A.LUsolve(b)
            u = 0
            for i in range(len(psi)):
                u += c[i,0]*psi[i]
            return u, c

Observe that we exploit the symmetry of the coefficient matrix:
only the upper triangular part is computed. Symbolic integration, also in
``sympy``, is often time consuming, and (roughly) halving the
work has noticeable effect on the waiting time for the computations to
finish.

Fall back on numerical integration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Obviously, ``sympy`` may fail to successfully integrate
:math:`\int_\Omega{\psi}_i{\psi}_jdx`, and
especially :math:`\int_\Omega f{\psi}_idx`, symbolically.
Therefore, we should extend
the ``least_squares`` function such that it falls back on
numerical integration if the symbolic integration is unsuccessful.
In the latter case, the returned value from ``sympy``'s
``integrate`` function is an object of type ``Integral``.
We can test on this type and utilize the ``mpmath`` module in
``sympy`` to perform numerical integration of high precision.
Even when ``sympy`` manages to integrate symbolically, it can
take an undesirable long time. We therefore include an
argument ``symbolic`` that governs whether or not to try
symbolic integration. Here is a complete and
improved version of the previous function ``least_squares``:

.. code-block:: python

        def least_squares(f, psi, Omega, symbolic=True):
            N = len(psi) - 1
            A = sym.zeros((N+1, N+1))
            b = sym.zeros((N+1, 1))
            x = sym.Symbol('x')
            for i in range(N+1):
                for j in range(i, N+1):
                    integrand = psi[i]*psi[j]
                    if symbolic:
                        I = sym.integrate(integrand, (x, Omega[0], Omega[1]))
                    if not symbolic or isinstance(I, sym.Integral):
                        # Could not integrate symbolically,
                        # fall back on numerical integration
                        integrand = sym.lambdify([x], integrand)
                        I = sym.mpmath.quad(integrand, [Omega[0], Omega[1]])
                    A[i,j] = A[j,i] = I
        
                integrand = psi[i]*f
                if symbolic:
                    I = sym.integrate(integrand, (x, Omega[0], Omega[1]))
                if not symbolic or isinstance(I, sym.Integral):
                    integrand = sym.lambdify([x], integrand)
                    I = sym.mpmath.quad(integrand, [Omega[0], Omega[1]])
                b[i,0] = I
            c = A.LUsolve(b)  # symbolic solve
            # c is a sympy Matrix object, numbers are in c[i,0]
            u = sum(c[i,0]*psi[i] for i in range(len(psi)))
            return u, [c[i,0] for i in range(len(c))]

The function is found in the file ``approx1D.py``.

Plotting the approximation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Comparing the given :math:`f(x)` and the approximate :math:`u(x)` visually is done
by the following function, which utilizes ``sympy``'s ``lambdify`` tool to
convert a ``sympy`` expression to a Python function for numerical
computations:

.. code-block:: python

        def comparison_plot(f, u, Omega, filename='tmp.pdf'):
            x = sym.Symbol('x')
            f = sym.lambdify([x], f, modules="numpy")
            u = sym.lambdify([x], u, modules="numpy")
            resolution = 401  # no of points in plot
            xcoor  = linspace(Omega[0], Omega[1], resolution)
            exact  = f(xcoor)
            approx = u(xcoor)
            plot(xcoor, approx)
            hold('on')
            plot(xcoor, exact)
            legend(['approximation', 'exact'])
            savefig(filename)

The ``modules='numpy'`` argument to ``lambdify`` is important
if there are mathematical functions, such as ``sin`` or ``exp``
in the symbolic expressions in ``f`` or ``u``, and these
mathematical functions are to be used with vector arguments, like
``xcoor`` above.

Both the ``least_squares`` and ``comparison_plot`` functions are found in
the file `approx1D.py <http://tinyurl.com/nm5587k/fem/approx1D.py>`__.  The file
``ex_approx1D.py`` applies this module to accomplish the forthcoming
examples.

.. _fem:approx:global:exact:

Perfect approximation
---------------------

Let us use the code above to recompute the problem from
the section :ref:`fem:approx:global:linear` where we want to approximate
a parabola. What happens if we add an element :math:`x^2` to the basis and test what
the best approximation is if :math:`V` is the space of all parabolic functions?
The answer is quickly found by running

.. code-block:: python

        >>> from approx1D import *
        >>> x = sym.Symbol('x')
        >>> f = 10*(x-1)**2-1
        >>> u, c = least_squares(f=f, psi=[1, x, x**2], Omega=[1, 2])
        >>> print u
        10*x**2 - 20*x + 9
        >>> print sym.expand(f)
        10*x**2 - 20*x + 9

Now, what if we use :math:`{\psi}_i(x)=x^i` for :math:`i=0,1,\ldots,N=40`?
The output from ``least_squares`` gives :math:`c_i=0` for :math:`i>2`, which
means that the method finds the perfect approximation.

In fact, we have a general result that
if :math:`f\in V`, the least squares and projection/Galerkin methods compute
the exact solution :math:`u=f`.
The proof is straightforward: if :math:`f\in V`, :math:`f` can be expanded in
terms of the basis functions, :math:`f=\sum_{j\in{\mathcal{I}_s}} d_j{\psi}_j`, for
some coefficients :math:`\left\{ {d}_i \right\}_{i\in{\mathcal{I}_s}}`,
and the right-hand side then has entries

.. math::
         b_i = (f,{\psi}_i) = \sum_{j\in{\mathcal{I}_s}} d_j({\psi}_j, {\psi}_i) = \sum_{j\in{\mathcal{I}_s}} d_jA_{i,j}
        {\thinspace .}  

The linear system :math:`\sum_jA_{i,j}c_j = b_i`, :math:`i\in{\mathcal{I}_s}`, is then

.. math::
         \sum_{j\in{\mathcal{I}_s}} c_jA_{i,j} = \sum_{j\in{\mathcal{I}_s}}d_jA_{i,j},
        \quad i\in{\mathcal{I}_s},

which implies that :math:`c_i=d_i` for :math:`i\in{\mathcal{I}_s}`.

.. _fem:approx:global:illconditioning:

Ill-conditioning
----------------

The computational example in the section :ref:`fem:approx:global:exact`
applies the ``least_squares`` function which invokes symbolic
methods to calculate and solve the linear system. The correct
solution :math:`c_0=9, c_1=-20, c_2=10, c_i=0` for :math:`i\geq 3` is perfectly
recovered.

Suppose we
convert the matrix and right-hand side to floating-point arrays
and then solve the system using finite-precision arithmetics, which
is what one will (almost) always do in real life. This time we
get astonishing results! Up to about :math:`N=7` we get a solution that
is reasonably close to the exact one. Increasing :math:`N` shows that
seriously wrong coefficients are computed.
Below is a table showing the solution of the linear system arising from
approximating a parabola
by functions on the form :math:`u(x)=c_0 + c_1x + c_2x^2 + \cdots + c_{10}x^{10}`.
Analytically, we know that :math:`c_j=0` for :math:`j>2`, but numerically we may get
:math:`c_j\neq 0` for :math:`j>2`.

The exact value of :math:`c_j`, :math:`j=0,1,\ldots,10`, appears in the first
column while the other columns correspond to results obtained
by three different methods:

  * Column 2: The matrix and vector are converted to
    the data structure  ``sympy.mpmath.fp.matrix`` and the
    ``sympy.mpmath.fp.lu_solve`` function is used to solve the system.

  * Column 3: The matrix and vector are converted to
    ``numpy`` arrays with data type ``numpy.float32``
    (single precision floating-point number) and solved by
    the ``numpy.linalg.solve`` function.

  * Column 4: As column 3, but the data type is
    ``numpy.float64`` (double
    precision floating-point number).

We see from the numbers in the table that
double precision performs much better than single precision.
Nevertheless, when plotting all these solutions the curves cannot be
visually distinguished (!). This means that the approximations look
perfect, despite the partially very wrong values of the coefficients.

Increasing :math:`N` to 12 makes the numerical solver in ``numpy``
abort with the message: "matrix is numerically singular".
A matrix has to be non-singular to be invertible, which is a requirement
when solving a linear system. Already when the matrix is close to
singular, it is *ill-conditioned*, which here implies that
the numerical solution algorithms are sensitive to round-off
errors and may produce (very) inaccurate results.

The reason why the coefficient matrix is nearly singular and
ill-conditioned is that our basis functions :math:`{\psi}_i(x)=x^i` are
nearly linearly dependent for large :math:`i`.  That is, :math:`x^i` and :math:`x^{i+1}`
are very close for :math:`i` not very small. This phenomenon is
illustrated in Figure :ref:`fem:approx:global:fig:illconditioning`.
There are 15 lines in this figure, but only half of them are
visually distinguishable.
Almost linearly dependent basis functions give rise to an
ill-conditioned and almost singular matrix.  This fact can be
illustrated by computing the determinant, which is indeed very close
to zero (recall that a zero determinant implies a singular and
non-invertible matrix): :math:`10^{-65}` for :math:`N=10` and :math:`10^{-92}` for
:math:`N=12`. Already for :math:`N=28` the numerical determinant computation
returns a plain zero.

   :width: 600

   The 15 first basis functions :math:`x^i`, :math:`i=0,\ldots,14`

On the other hand, the double precision ``numpy`` solver does run for
:math:`N=100`, resulting in answers that are not significantly worse than
those in the table above, and large powers are
associated with small coefficients (e.g., :math:`c_j<10^{-2}` for :math:`10\leq
j\leq 20` and :math:`c<10^{-5}` for :math:`j>20`). Even for :math:`N=100` the
approximation still lies on top of the exact curve in a plot (!).

The conclusion is that visual inspection of the quality of the approximation
may not uncover fundamental numerical problems with the computations.
However, numerical analysts have studied approximations and ill-conditioning
for decades, and it is well known that the basis :math:`\{1,x,x^2,x^3,\ldots,\}`
is a bad basis. The best basis from a matrix conditioning point of view
is to have orthogonal functions such that :math:`(\psi_i,\psi_j)=0` for
:math:`i\neq j`. There are many known sets of orthogonal polynomials and
other functions.
The functions used in the finite element methods are almost orthogonal,
and this property helps to avoid problems with solving matrix systems.
Almost orthogonal is helpful, but not enough when it comes to
partial differential equations, and ill-conditioning
of the coefficient matrix is a theme when solving large-scale matrix
systems arising from finite element discretizations.

   single: approximation; by sines

A set of sine functions is widely used for approximating functions
(the sines are also orthogonal as explained more in the section :ref:`fem:approx:global:illconditioning`).  Let us take

.. math::
        
        V = \hbox{span}\,\{ \sin \pi x, \sin 2\pi x,\ldots,\sin (N+1)\pi x\}
        {\thinspace .}  

That is,

.. math::
         {\psi}_i(x) = \sin ((i+1)\pi x),\quad i\in{\mathcal{I}_s}{\thinspace .} 

An approximation to the parabola :math:`f(x)=10(x-1)^2-1` for :math:`x\in\Omega=[1,2]` from
the section :ref:`fem:approx:global:linear` can then be computed by the
``least_squares`` function from the section :ref:`fem:approx:global:LS:code`:

.. code-block:: python

        N = 3
        import sympy as sym
        x = sym.Symbol('x')
        psi = [sym.sin(sym.pi*(i+1)*x) for i in range(N+1)]
        f = 10*(x-1)**2 - 1
        Omega = [0, 1]
        u, c = least_squares(f, psi, Omega)
        comparison_plot(f, u, Omega)

Figure :ref:`fem:approx:global:fig:parabola:sine1` (left) shows the oscillatory approximation
of :math:`\sum_{j=0}^Nc_j\sin ((j+1)\pi x)` when :math:`N=3`.
Changing :math:`N` to 11 improves the approximation considerably, see
Figure :ref:`fem:approx:global:fig:parabola:sine1` (right).

   *Best approximation of a parabola by a sum of 3 (left) and 11 (right) sine functions*

There is an error :math:`f(0)-u(0)=9` at :math:`x=0` in Figure :ref:`fem:approx:global:fig:parabola:sine1` regardless of how large :math:`N` is, because all :math:`{\psi}_i(0)=0` and hence
:math:`u(0)=0`. We may help the approximation to be correct at :math:`x=0` by
seeking

.. math::
        
        u(x) = f(0) + \sum_{j\in{\mathcal{I}_s}} c_j{\psi}_j(x)
        {\thinspace .}
        

However, this adjustment introduces a new problem at :math:`x=1` since
we now get an error :math:`f(1)-u(1)=f(1)-0=-1` at this point. A more
clever adjustment is to replace the :math:`f(0)` term by a term that
is :math:`f(0)` at :math:`x=0` and :math:`f(1)` at :math:`x=1`. A simple linear combination
:math:`f(0)(1-x) + xf(1)` does the job:

.. math::
        
        u(x) = f(0)(1-x) + xf(1) + \sum_{j\in{\mathcal{I}_s}} c_j{\psi}_j(x)
        {\thinspace .}
        

This adjustment of :math:`u` alters the linear system slightly. In the general
case, we set

.. math::
         u(x) = B(x) +  \sum_{j\in{\mathcal{I}_s}} c_j{\psi}_j(x),

and the linear system becomes

.. math::
         \sum_{j\in{\mathcal{I}_s}}({\psi}_i,{\psi}_j)c_j = (f-B,{\psi}_i),\quad i\in{\mathcal{I}_s}{\thinspace .}

The calculations can still utilize the ``least_squares`` or
``least_squares_orth`` functions, but solve for :math:`u-b`:

.. code-block:: python

        f0 = 0;  f1 = -1
        B = f0*(1-x) + x*f1
        u_sum, c = least_squares_orth(f-b, psi, Omega)
        u = B + u_sum

Figure :ref:`fem:approx:global:fig:parabola:sine2` shows the result
of the technique for
ensuring right boundary values. Even 3 sines can now adjust the
:math:`f(0)(1-x) + xf(1)` term such that :math:`u` approximates the parabola really
well, at least visually.

.. _fem:approx:global:orth:

Orthogonal basis functions
--------------------------

The choice of sine functions :math:`{\psi}_i(x)=\sin ((i+1)\pi x)` has a great
computational advantage: on :math:`\Omega=[0,1]` these basis functions are
*orthogonal*, implying that :math:`A_{i,j}=0` if :math:`i\neq j`. This
result is realized by trying

.. code-block:: python

        integrate(sin(j*pi*x)*sin(k*pi*x), x, 0, 1)

in `WolframAlpha <http://wolframalpha.com>`__
(avoid ``i`` in the integrand as this symbol means
the imaginary unit :math:`\sqrt{-1}`).
Asking WolframAlpha also
about :math:`\int_0^1\sin^2 (j\pi x) {\, \mathrm{d}x}`, we find that it equals
1/2.
With a diagonal matrix we can easily solve for the coefficients
by hand:

.. math::
        
        c_i = 2\int_0^1 f(x)\sin ((i+1)\pi x) {\, \mathrm{d}x},\quad i\in{\mathcal{I}_s},
        

which is nothing but the classical formula for the coefficients of
the Fourier sine series of :math:`f(x)` on :math:`[0,1]`. In fact, when
:math:`V` contains the basic functions used in a Fourier series expansion,
the approximation method derived in the section :ref:`fem:approx:global`
results in the classical Fourier series for :math:`f(x)` (see :ref:`fem:approx:exer:Fourier`
for details).

With orthogonal basis functions we can make the
``least_squares`` function (much) more efficient since we know that
the matrix is diagonal and only the diagonal elements need to be computed:

.. code-block:: python

        def least_squares_orth(f, psi, Omega):
            N = len(psi) - 1
            A = [0]*(N+1)
            b = [0]*(N+1)
            x = sym.Symbol('x')
            for i in range(N+1):
                A[i] = sym.integrate(psi[i]**2, (x, Omega[0], Omega[1]))
                b[i] = sym.integrate(psi[i]*f,  (x, Omega[0], Omega[1]))
            c = [b[i]/A[i] for i in range(len(b))]
            u = 0
            for i in range(len(psi)):
                u += c[i]*psi[i]
            return u, c

As mentioned in the section :ref:`fem:approx:global:LS:code`, symbolic integration
may fail or take very long time. It is therefore natural to extend the
implementation above with a version where we can choose between symbolic
and numerical integration and fall back on the latter if the former
fails:

.. code-block:: python

        def least_squares_orth(f, psi, Omega, symbolic=True):
            N = len(psi) - 1
            A = [0]*(N+1)       # plain list to hold symbolic expressions
            b = [0]*(N+1)
            x = sym.Symbol('x')
            for i in range(N+1):
                # Diagonal matrix term
                A[i] = sym.integrate(psi[i]**2, (x, Omega[0], Omega[1]))
        
                # Right-hand side term
                integrand = psi[i]*f
                if symbolic:
                    I = sym.integrate(integrand,  (x, Omega[0], Omega[1]))
                if not symbolic or isinstance(I, sym.Integral):
                    print 'numerical integration of', integrand
                    integrand = sym.lambdify([x], integrand)
                    I = sym.mpmath.quad(integrand, [Omega[0], Omega[1]])
                b[i] = I
            c = [b[i]/A[i] for i in range(len(b))]
            u = 0
            u = sum(c[i,0]*psi[i] for i in range(len(psi)))
            return u, c

This function is found in the file ``approx1D.py``. Observe that
we here assume that
:math:`\int_\Omega{\varphi}_i^2dx` can always be symbolically computed,
which is not an unreasonable assumption
when the basis functions are orthogonal, but there is no guarantee,
so an improved version of the function above would implement
numerical integration also for the ``A[i,i]`` term.

Numerical computations
----------------------

Sometimes the basis functions :math:`{\psi}_i` and/or the function :math:`f`
have a nature that makes symbolic integration CPU-time
consuming or impossible.
Even though we implemented a fall back on numerical integration
of :math:`\int f{\varphi}_i dx`, considerable time might still be required
by ``sympy`` just by *attempting* to integrate symbolically.
Therefore, it will be handy to have function for fast
*numerical integration and numerical solution
of the linear system*. Below is such a method. It requires
Python functions ``f(x)`` and ``psi(x,i)`` for :math:`f(x)` and :math:`{\psi}_i(x)`
as input. The output is a mesh function
with values ``u`` on the mesh with points in the array ``x``.
Three numerical integration methods are offered:
``scipy.integrate.quad`` (precision set to :math:`10^{-8}`),
``sympy.mpmath.quad`` (about machine precision), and a Trapezoidal
rule based on the points in ``x`` (unknown accuracy, but
increasing with the number of mesh points in ``x``).

The interpolation (or collocation) method
-----------------------------------------

.. index:: collocation method (approximation)

.. index::
   single: approximation; collocation

The principle of minimizing the distance between :math:`u` and :math:`f` is
an intuitive way of computing a best approximation :math:`u\in V` to :math:`f`.
However, there are other approaches as well.
One is to demand that :math:`u(x_{i}) = f(x_{i})` at some selected points
:math:`x_{i}`, :math:`i\in{\mathcal{I}_s}`:

.. math::
        
        u(x_{i}) = \sum_{j\in{\mathcal{I}_s}} c_j {\psi}_j(x_{i}) = f(x_{i}),
        \quad i\in{\mathcal{I}_s}{\thinspace .} 

We recognize that the equation :math:`\sum_j c_j {\psi}_j(x_{i}) = f(x_{i})`
is actually a linear system with :math:`N+1` unknown coefficients :math:`\left\{ {c}_i \right\}_{i\in{\mathcal{I}_s}}`:

.. math::
        
        \sum_{j\in{\mathcal{I}_s}} A_{i,j}c_j = b_i,\quad i\in{\mathcal{I}_s},
        

with coefficient matrix and right-hand side vector given by

.. math::
        
        A_{i,j} = {\psi}_j(x_{i}),
        

.. math::
          
        b_i = f(x_{i}){\thinspace .}  

This time the coefficient matrix is not symmetric because
:math:`{\psi}_j(x_{i})\neq {\psi}_i(x_{j})` in general.
The method is often referred to as an *interpolation method*
since some point values of :math:`f` are given (:math:`f(x_{i})`) and we
fit a continuous function :math:`u` that goes through the :math:`f(x_{i})` points.
In this case the :math:`x_{i}` points are called *interpolation points*.
When the same approach is used to approximate differential equations,
one usually applies the name *collocation method* and
:math:`x_{i}` are known as *collocation points*.

.. index:: interpolation

.. index::
   single: approximation; interpolation

Given :math:`f`  as a ``sympy`` symbolic expression ``f``, :math:`\left\{ {{\psi}}_i \right\}_{i\in{\mathcal{I}_s}}`
as a list ``psi``, and a set of points :math:`\left\{ {x}_i \right\}_{i\in{\mathcal{I}_s}}`  as a list or array
``points``, the following Python function sets up and solves the matrix system
for the coefficients :math:`\left\{ {c}_i \right\}_{i\in{\mathcal{I}_s}}`:

.. code-block:: python

        def interpolation(f, psi, points):
            N = len(psi) - 1
            A = sym.zeros((N+1, N+1))
            b = sym.zeros((N+1, 1))
            x = sym.Symbol('x')
            # Turn psi and f into Python functions
            psi = [sym.lambdify([x], psi[i]) for i in range(N+1)]
            f = sym.lambdify([x], f)
            for i in range(N+1):
                for j in range(N+1):
                    A[i,j] = psi[j](points[i])
                b[i,0] = f(points[i])
            c = A.LUsolve(b)
            u = 0
            for i in range(len(psi)):
                u += c[i,0]*psi[i](x)
            return u

The ``interpolation`` function is a part of the ``approx1D``
module.

We found it convenient in the above function to turn the expressions ``f`` and
``psi`` into ordinary Python functions of ``x``, which can be called with
``float`` values in the list ``points`` when building the matrix and
the right-hand side. The alternative is to use the ``subs`` method
to substitute the ``x`` variable in an expression by an element from
the ``points`` list. The following session illustrates both approaches
in a simple setting:

.. code-block:: ipy

        >>> import sympy as sym
        >>> x = sym.Symbol('x')
        >>> e = x**2              # symbolic expression involving x
        >>> p = 0.5               # a value of x
        >>> v = e.subs(x, p)      # evaluate e for x=p
        >>> v
        0.250000000000000
        >>> type(v)
        sympy.core.numbers.Float
        >>> e = lambdify([x], e)  # make Python function of e
        >>> type(e)
        >>> function
        >>> v = e(p)              # evaluate e(x) for x=p
        >>> v
        0.25
        >>> type(v)
        float

A nice feature of the interpolation or collocation method is that it
avoids computing integrals. However, one has to decide on the location
of the :math:`x_{i}` points.  A simple, yet common choice, is to
distribute them uniformly throughout :math:`\Omega`.

Example  (1)
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let us illustrate the interpolation method by approximating
our parabola :math:`f(x)=10(x-1)^2-1` by a linear function on :math:`\Omega=[1,2]`,
using two collocation points :math:`x_0=1+1/3` and :math:`x_1=1+2/3`:

.. code-block:: python

        f = 10*(x-1)**2 - 1
        psi = [1, x]
        Omega = [1, 2]
        points = [1 + sym.Rational(1,3), 1 + sym.Rational(2,3)]
        u = interpolation(f, psi, points)
        comparison_plot(f, u, Omega)

The resulting linear system becomes

.. math::
        
        \left(\begin{array}{ll}
        1 & 4/3\\ 
        1 & 5/3\\ 
        \end{array}\right)
        \left(\begin{array}{l}
        c_0\\ 
        c_1\\ 
        \end{array}\right)
        =
        \left(\begin{array}{l}
        1/9\\ 
        31/9\\ 
        \end{array}\right)
        

with solution :math:`c_0=-119/9` and :math:`c_1=10`.
Figure :ref:`fem:approx:global:linear:interp:fig1` (left) shows the resulting
approximation :math:`u=-119/9 + 10x`.
We can easily test other interpolation points, say :math:`x_0=1` and :math:`x_1=2`.
This changes the line quite significantly, see
Figure :ref:`fem:approx:global:linear:interp:fig1` (right).

Lagrange polynomials
--------------------

.. index:: Lagrange (interpolating) polynomial

In the section :ref:`fem:approx:global:Fourier` we explained the advantage with having
a diagonal matrix: formulas for the coefficients :math:`\left\{ {c}_i \right\}_{i\in{\mathcal{I}_s}}` can
then be derived by hand. For an interpolation (or collocation) method a
diagonal matrix implies that
:math:`{\psi}_j(x_{i}) = 0` if :math:`i\neq j`. One set of basis functions :math:`{\psi}_i(x)`
with this property is the *Lagrange interpolating polynomials*,
or just *Lagrange polynomials*. (Although the functions are named
after Lagrange, they were first discovered by Waring in 1779,
rediscovered by Euler in 1783, and published by Lagrange in 1795.)
Lagrange polynomials key building blocks in the finite element method, so
familiarity with these polynomials will be required anyway.

A Lagrange polynomial can be written as

.. _Eq:fem:approx:global:Lagrange:poly:

.. math::
   :label: fem:approx:global:Lagrange:poly
        
        {\psi}_i(x) =
        \prod_{j=0,j\neq i}^N
        \frac{x-x_{j}}{x_{i}-x_{j}}
        = \frac{x-x_0}{x_{i}-x_0}\cdots\frac{x-x_{i-1}}{x_{i}-x_{i-1}}\frac{x-x_{i+1}}{x_{i}-x_{i+1}}
        \cdots\frac{x-x_N}{x_{i}-x_N},
        
        

for :math:`i\in{\mathcal{I}_s}`.
We see from :eq:`fem:approx:global:Lagrange:poly` that all the :math:`{\psi}_i`
functions are polynomials of degree :math:`N` which have the property

.. index:: Kronecker delta

.. _Eq:fem:inter:prop:

.. math::
   :label: fem:inter:prop
        
        {\psi}_i(x_s) = \delta_{is},\quad \delta_{is} =
        \left\lbrace\begin{array}{ll}
        1, & i=s,\\ 
        0, & i\neq s,
        \end{array}\right.
        
        

when :math:`x_s` is an interpolation (collocation) point.
Here we have used the *Kronecker delta* symbol :math:`\delta_{is}`.
This property implies that :math:`A_{i,j}=0` for :math:`i\neq j` and
:math:`A_{i,j}=1` when :math:`i=j`. The solution of the linear system is
then simply

.. math::
        
        c_i = f(x_{i}),\quad i\in{\mathcal{I}_s},
        

and

.. math::
        
        u(x) = \sum_{j\in{\mathcal{I}_s}} f(x_{i}){\psi}_i(x){\thinspace .}  

The following function computes the Lagrange interpolating polynomial
:math:`{\psi}_i(x)`, given the interpolation points :math:`x_{0},\ldots,x_{N}` in
the list or array ``points``:

.. code-block:: python

        def Lagrange_polynomial(x, i, points):
            p = 1
            for k in range(len(points)):
                if k != i:
                    p *= (x - points[k])/(points[i] - points[k])
            return p

The next function computes a complete basis using equidistant points throughout
:math:`\Omega`:

.. code-block:: python

        def Lagrange_polynomials_01(x, N):
            if isinstance(x, sym.Symbol):
                h = sym.Rational(1, N-1)
            else:
                h = 1.0/(N-1)
            points = [i*h for i in range(N)]
            psi = [Lagrange_polynomial(x, i, points) for i in range(N)]
            return psi, points

When ``x`` is an ``sym.Symbol`` object, we let the
spacing between
the interpolation points, ``h``, be a ``sympy`` rational number, so
that we get nice end results in the formulas for :math:`{\psi}_i`.
The other case, when ``x`` is a plain Python ``float``,
signifies numerical computing, and then we let ``h`` be a floating-point
number.
Observe that the ``Lagrange_polynomial`` function works equally well
in the symbolic and numerical case - just think of ``x`` being an
``sym.Symbol`` object or a Python ``float``.
A little interactive session illustrates the difference between symbolic
and numerical computing of the basis functions and points:

.. code-block:: ipy

        >>> import sympy as sym
        >>> x = sym.Symbol('x')
        >>> psi, points = Lagrange_polynomials_01(x, N=3)
        >>> points
        [0, 1/2, 1]
        >>> psi
        [(1 - x)*(1 - 2*x), 2*x*(2 - 2*x), -x*(1 - 2*x)]
        
        >>> x = 0.5  # numerical computing
        >>> psi, points = Lagrange_polynomials_01(x, N=3)
        >>> points
        [0.0, 0.5, 1.0]
        >>> psi
        [-0.0, 1.0, 0.0]

The Lagrange polynomials are very much used in finite element methods
because of their property :eq:`fem:inter:prop`.

Approximation of a polynomial
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Galerkin or least squares method lead to an exact approximation
if :math:`f` lies in the space spanned by the basis functions. It could be
of interest to see how the interpolation method with Lagrange
polynomials as basis is able to approximate a polynomial, e.g.,
a parabola. Running

.. code-block:: python

        for N in 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12:
            f = x**2
            psi, points = Lagrange_polynomials_01(x, N)
            u = interpolation(f, psi, points)

shows the result that up to ``N=4`` we achieve an exact approximation,
and then round-off errors start to grow, such that
``N=15`` leads to a 15-degree polynomial for :math:`u` where
the coefficients in front of :math:`x^r` for :math:`r>2` are
of size :math:`10^{-5}` and smaller.

Successful example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Trying out the Lagrange polynomial basis for approximating
:math:`f(x)=\sin 2\pi x` on :math:`\Omega =[0,1]` with the least squares
and the interpolation techniques can be done by

.. code-block:: python

        x = sym.Symbol('x')
        f = sym.sin(2*sym.pi*x)
        psi, points = Lagrange_polynomials_01(x, N)
        Omega=[0, 1]
        u, c = least_squares(f, psi, Omega)
        comparison_plot(f, u, Omega)
        u, c = interpolation(f, psi, points)
        comparison_plot(f, u, Omega)

Figure :ref:`fem:approx:global:Lagrange:fig:sine:ls:colloc` shows the results.
There is little difference between the least squares and the interpolation
technique. Increasing :math:`N` gives visually better approximations.

.. index:: Runge's phenomenon

Less successful example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The next example concerns interpolating :math:`f(x)=|1-2x|` on
:math:`\Omega =[0,1]` using Lagrange polynomials. Figure :ref:`fem:approx:global:Lagrange:fig:abs:Lag:unif:7:14` shows a peculiar effect: the approximation starts to oscillate
more and more as :math:`N` grows. This numerical artifact is not surprising
when looking at the individual Lagrange polynomials. Figure :ref:`fem:approx:global:Lagrange:fig:abs:Lag:unif:osc` shows two such polynomials, :math:`\psi_2(x)` and
:math:`\psi_7(x)`, both of degree 11 and computed from uniformly spaced
points :math:`x_{x_i}=i/11`, :math:`i=0,\ldots,11`, marked with circles.
We clearly see the property of Lagrange polynomials:
:math:`\psi_2(x_{i})=0` and :math:`\psi_7(x_{i})=0` for all :math:`i`,
except :math:`\psi_2(x_{2})=1` and :math:`\psi_7(x_{7})=1`.
The most striking feature, however, is the significant oscillation
near the boundary. The reason is easy to understand:
since we force the functions to zero at so many points,
a polynomial of high degree is forced to oscillate between
the points.
The phenomenon is named *Runge's phenomenon* and you can read
a more detailed explanation on `Wikipedia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%27s_phenomenon>`__.

.. index:: Chebyshev nodes

Remedy for strong oscillations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The oscillations can be reduced by a more clever choice of
interpolation points, called the *Chebyshev nodes*:

.. math::
        
        x_{i} = \frac{1}{2} (a+b) + \frac{1}{2}(b-a)\cos\left( \frac{2i+1}{2(N+1)}pi\right),\quad i=0\ldots,N,
        

on the interval :math:`\Omega = [a,b]`.
Here is a flexible version of the ``Lagrange_polynomials_01`` function above,
valid for any interval :math:`\Omega =[a,b]` and with the possibility to generate
both uniformly distributed points and Chebyshev nodes:

.. code-block:: python

        def Lagrange_polynomials(x, N, Omega, point_distribution='uniform'):
            if point_distribution == 'uniform':
                if isinstance(x, sym.Symbol):
                    h = sym.Rational(Omega[1] - Omega[0], N)
                else:
                    h = (Omega[1] - Omega[0])/float(N)
                points = [Omega[0] + i*h for i in range(N+1)]
            elif point_distribution == 'Chebyshev':
                points = Chebyshev_nodes(Omega[0], Omega[1], N)
            psi = [Lagrange_polynomial(x, i, points) for i in range(N+1)]
            return psi, points
        
        def Chebyshev_nodes(a, b, N):
            from math import cos, pi
            return [0.5*(a+b) + 0.5*(b-a)*cos(float(2*i+1)/(2*N+1))*pi) \ 
                    for i in range(N+1)]

All the functions computing Lagrange polynomials listed
above are found in the module file ``Lagrange.py``.

Figure :ref:`fem:approx:global:Lagrange:fig:abs:Lag:Cheb:7:14` shows the improvement of
using Chebyshev nodes, compared with the equidistant points in
Figure :ref:`fem:approx:global:Lagrange:fig:abs:Lag:unif:7:14`.
The reason for this improvement is that the corresponding Lagrange
polynomials have much smaller oscillations, which can be seen by
comparing Figure :ref:`fem:approx:global:Lagrange:fig:abs:Lag:Cheb:osc`
(Chebyshev points)
with Figure :ref:`fem:approx:global:Lagrange:fig:abs:Lag:unif:osc`
(equidistant points). Note the different scale on the vertical axes in
the two figures.

Another cure for undesired oscillations of higher-degree interpolating
polynomials is to use lower-degree Lagrange
polynomials on many small patches of the domain. This is actually the idea
pursued in the finite element method. For instance, linear Lagrange
polynomials on :math:`[0,1/2]` and :math:`[1/2,1]` would yield a perfect
approximation to :math:`f(x)=|1-2x|` on :math:`\Omega = [0,1]`
since :math:`f` is piecewise linear.

How does the least squares or projection methods work with Lagrange
polynomials?
We can just call the ``least_squares`` function, but
``sympy`` has problems integrating the :math:`f(x)=|1-2x|`
function times a polynomial, so we need to fall back on numerical
integration.

.. code-block:: python

        def least_squares(f, psi, Omega):
            N = len(psi) - 1
            A = sym.zeros((N+1, N+1))
            b = sym.zeros((N+1, 1))
            x = sym.Symbol('x')
            for i in range(N+1):
                for j in range(i, N+1):
                    integrand = psi[i]*psi[j]
                    I = sym.integrate(integrand, (x, Omega[0], Omega[1]))
                    if isinstance(I, sym.Integral):
                        # Could not integrate symbolically, fall back
                        # on numerical integration with mpmath.quad
                        integrand = sym.lambdify([x], integrand)
                        I = sym.mpmath.quad(integrand, [Omega[0], Omega[1]])
                    A[i,j] = A[j,i] = I
                integrand = psi[i]*f
                I = sym.integrate(integrand, (x, Omega[0], Omega[1]))
                if isinstance(I, sym.Integral):
                    integrand = sym.lambdify([x], integrand)
                    I = sym.mpmath.quad(integrand, [Omega[0], Omega[1]])
                b[i,0] = I
            c = A.LUsolve(b)
            u = 0
            for i in range(len(psi)):
                u += c[i,0]*psi[i]
            return u

.. Convergence of Lagrange polynomials.

The idea of avoiding oscillatory solutions by
using lower-order Lagrange polynomials on smaller patches
throughout the domain, is important in the finite element
method, and the next section introduces finite element basis
functions based on Lagrange polynomials.
