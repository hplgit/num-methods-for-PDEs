Finite element basis functions
==============================

The specific basis functions exemplified in the section :ref:`fem:approx:global` are in general nonzero on the entire domain
:math:`\Omega`, as can be seen in Figure :ref:`fem:approx:fe:fig:u:sin`,
where we plot two sinusoidal basis functions :math:`\psi_0(x)=\sin\frac{1}{2}\pi x` and
:math:`\psi_1(x)=\sin 2\pi x` together with the sum
:math:`u(x)=4\psi_0(x) - \frac{1}{2}\psi_1(x)`. We shall
now turn our attention to basis functions that have *compact support*,
meaning that they are nonzero on a small portion of
:math:`\Omega` only. Moreover, we shall restrict the functions to be *piecewise
polynomials*. This means that the domain is split into subdomains and
each basis function is a polynomial on one or more of these
subdomains, see Figure
:ref:`fem:approx:fe:fig:u:fe` for a sketch involving locally defined
hat functions that make :math:`u=\sum_jc_j{\psi}_j` piecewise linear. At
the boundaries between subdomains, one normally just forces continuity of
:math:`u`, so that when connecting two polynomials from two
subdomains, the derivative becomes discontinuous. This type
of basis functions is fundamental in the finite element method.
(One may wonder why continuity of derivatives is not desired, and it
is, but it turns out to be mathematically challenging
in 2D and 3D, and it is not strictly needed.)

We first introduce the concepts of elements and nodes in a simplistic fashion,
as often met in the literature. Later, we shall generalize the concept
of an element, which is a necessary step before treating a wider class of
approximations within the family of finite element methods.
The generalization is also compatible with
the concepts used in the `FEniCS <http://fenicsproject.org>`__ finite
element software.

.. _fem:approx:fe:def:elements:nodes:

Elements and nodes
------------------

Let :math:`u` and :math:`f` be defined on an interval :math:`\Omega`. We
divide :math:`\Omega`
into :math:`N_e` non-overlapping subintervals :math:`\Omega^{(e)}`, :math:`e=0,\ldots,N_e-1`:

.. _Eq:_auto32:

.. math::
   :label: _auto32
        
        \Omega = \Omega^{(0)}\cup \cdots \cup \Omega^{(N_e)}{\thinspace .}   
        

We shall for now
refer to :math:`\Omega^{(e)}` as an *element*, identified by the unique number :math:`e`.
On each element we introduce a set of points called *nodes*.
For now we assume that the nodes are uniformly spaced throughout the
element and that the boundary points of the elements are also nodes.
The nodes are given numbers both within an element and in the global
domain. These are
referred to as *local* and *global* node numbers, respectively.
Local nodes are numbered with an index :math:`r=0,\ldots,d`, while the
:math:`N_n` global nodes are numbered as :math:`i=0,\ldots,N_n-1`.
Figure :ref:`fem:approx:fe:def:elements:nodes:fig:P1` shows
nodes as small circular
disks and element boundaries as small vertical lines.
Global node numbers appear under the nodes, but local node numbers
are not shown. Since there are two nodes in each elements, the local
nodes are numbered 0 (left) and 1 (right) in each element.

   *Finite element mesh with 5 elements and 6 nodes*

.. index:: finite element mesh

.. index::
   single: mesh; finite elements

Nodes and elements uniquely define a *finite element mesh*, which is our
discrete representation of the domain in the computations.
A common special case is that of a *uniformly partitioned mesh* where
each element has the same length and the distance between nodes is constant.
Figure :ref:`fem:approx:fe:def:elements:nodes:fig:P1` shows
an example on a uniformly partitioned mesh. The strength of the finite
element method (in contrast to the
finite difference method)
is that it is equally easy to work with a non-uniformly
partitioned mesh as a uniformly partitioned one.

Example  (3)
~~~~~~~~~~~~

On :math:`\Omega =[0,1]` we may introduce two elements,
:math:`\Omega^{(0)}=[0,0.4]` and :math:`\Omega^{(1)}=[0.4,1]`. Furthermore,
let us introduce three nodes
per element, equally spaced within each element.
Figure :ref:`fem:approx:fe:def:elements:nodes:fig:P2` shows the
mesh with :math:`N_e=2` elements and :math:`N_n=2N_e+1=5` nodes.
A node's coordinate is denoted by :math:`x_i`, where :math:`i` is either a global
node number or a local one. In the latter case we also need to know
the element number to uniquely define the node.

The three nodes in element number 0 are
:math:`x_0=0`, :math:`x_1=0.2`, and :math:`x_2=0.4`.
The local and global node numbers are here equal.
In element number 1, we have the local nodes :math:`x_0=0.4`, :math:`x_1=0.7`, and :math:`x_2=1`
and the corresponding
global nodes :math:`x_2=0.4`, :math:`x_3=0.7`, and :math:`x_4=1`. Note that
the global node :math:`x_2=0.4` is shared by the two elements.

.. _fem:approx:fe:def:elements:nodes:fig:P2:

.. figure:: fe_mesh1D_P2.png
   :width: 500

   *Finite element mesh with 2 elements and 5 nodes*

For the purpose of implementation, we introduce two lists or arrays:
``nodes`` for storing the coordinates of the nodes, with the
global node numbers as indices, and ``elements`` for holding
the global node numbers in each element. By defining ``elements`` as a
list of lists, where each sublist contains the global node numbers of
one particular element, the indices of each sublist will correspond to
local node numbers for that element.
The ``nodes`` and ``elements`` lists for the sample mesh
above take the form

.. code-block:: python

        nodes = [0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.7, 1]
        elements = [[0, 1, 2], [2, 3, 4]]

Looking up the coordinate of, e.g., local node number 2 in element 1,
is done by ``nodes[elements[1][2]]`` (recall that nodes and
elements start their numbering at 0). The corresponding global node number
is 4, so we could alternatively look up the coordinate as ``nodes[4]``.

The numbering of elements and nodes does not need to be regular.
Figure :ref:`fem:approx:fe:def:elements:nodes:fig:P1:irregular` shows
and example corresponding to

.. code-block:: python

        nodes = [1.5, 5.5, 4.2, 0.3, 2.2, 3.1]
        elements = [[2, 1], [4, 5], [0, 4], [3, 0], [5, 2]]

   *Example on irregular numbering of elements and nodes*

The basis functions
-------------------

Construction principles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Finite element basis functions are in this text recognized by
the notation :math:`{\varphi}_i(x)`, where the index (now in the beginning)
corresponds to
a global node number. Since :math:`{\varphi}_i` is the symbol for basis
functions in general in this text, the particular choice of
finite element basis functions means that we take
:math:`{\psi}_i = {\varphi}_i`.

.. index:: internal node

.. index:: shared node

Let :math:`i` be the global node number corresponding to local node :math:`r` in
element number :math:`e` with :math:`d+1` local nodes. We distinguish between
*internal* nodes in an element and *shared* nodes. The latter are
nodes that are shared with the neighboring elements.
The finite element basis functions :math:`{\varphi}_i`
are now defined as follows.

  * For an internal node, with global number :math:`i` and local number :math:`r`,
    take :math:`{\varphi}_i(x)` to be the Lagrange
    polynomial that is 1 at the local node :math:`r` and zero
    at all other nodes in the element.
    The degree of the polynomial is :math:`d`, according to :ref:`(4.33) <Eq:fem:approx:global:Lagrange:poly>`.
    On all other elements, :math:`{\varphi}_i=0`.

  * For a shared node,
    let :math:`{\varphi}_i` be made up of the Lagrange polynomial on this element
    that is 1 at node :math:`i`, combined with the Lagrange polynomial over
    the neighboring element that is also 1 at node :math:`i`.
    On all other elements, :math:`{\varphi}_i=0`.

A visual impression of three such basis functions is given in
Figure :ref:`fem:approx:fe:fig:P2`.
The domain :math:`\Omega = [0,1]` is divided into four equal-sized elements,
each having three local nodes.
The element boundaries are
marked by vertical dashed lines and the nodes by small circles.
The function :math:`{\varphi}_2(x)`
is composed of a quadratic Lagrange polynomial over element 0 and 1,
:math:`{\varphi}_3(x)` corresponds to an internal node in element 1 and
is therefore nonzero on this element only, while :math:`{\varphi}_4(x)`
is like :math:`{\varphi}_2(x)` composed to two Lagrange polynomials over two
elements. Also observe that the basis function :math:`{\varphi}_i` is zero at
all nodes, except at global node number :math:`i`.
We also remark that
the shape of a basis function over an element is completely determined
by the coordinates of the local nodes in the element.

.. Sometimes we refer to a Lagrange polynomial on an element :math:`e`, which

.. means the basis function :math:`{\varphi}_i(x)` when :math:`x\in\Omega^{(e)}`, and

.. :math:`{\varphi}_i(x)=0` when :math:`x\notin\Omega^{(e)}`.

   *Illustration of the piecewise quadratic basis functions associated with nodes in an element*

Properties of :math:`{\varphi}_i`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The construction of basis functions according to the principles above
lead to two important properties of :math:`{\varphi}_i(x)`. First,

.. index:: Kronecker delta

.. _Eq:fem:approx:fe:phi:prop1:

.. math::
   :label: fem:approx:fe:phi:prop1
        
        {\varphi}_i(x_{j}) =\delta_{ij},\quad \delta_{ij} =
        \left\lbrace\begin{array}{ll}
        1, & i=j,\\ 
        0, & i\neq j,
        \end{array}\right.
        
        

when :math:`x_{j}` is a node in the mesh with global node number :math:`j`.
The
result :math:`{\varphi}_i(x_{j}) =\delta_{ij}` arises
because the Lagrange polynomials are constructed to have
exactly this property.
The property also implies a convenient interpretation of :math:`c_i`
as the value of :math:`u` at node :math:`i`. To show this, we expand :math:`u`
in the usual way as :math:`\sum_jc_j{\psi}_j` and choose :math:`{\psi}_i = {\varphi}_i`:

.. math::
        
        u(x_{i}) = \sum_{j\in{\mathcal{I}_s}} c_j {\psi}_j (x_{i}) =
        \sum_{j\in{\mathcal{I}_s}} c_j {\varphi}_j (x_{i}) = c_i {\varphi}_i (x_{i}) = c_i
        {\thinspace .}
        

Because of this interpretation,
the coefficient :math:`c_i` is by many named :math:`u_i` or :math:`U_i`.

.. 2DO: switch to U_j?

Second,
:math:`{\varphi}_i(x)` is mostly zero throughout the domain:

 * :math:`{\varphi}_i(x) \neq 0` only on those elements that contain global node :math:`i`,

 * :math:`{\varphi}_i(x){\varphi}_j(x) \neq 0` if and only if :math:`i` and :math:`j` are global node
   numbers in the same element.

Since :math:`A_{i,j}` is the integral of
:math:`{\varphi}_i{\varphi}_j` it means that
*most of the elements in the coefficient matrix will be zero*.
We will come back to these properties and use
them actively in computations to save memory and CPU time.

In our example so far, each element has :math:`d+1` nodes, resulting in
local Lagrange polynomials of degree :math:`d` (according to the section :ref:`fem:approx:global:Lagrange`), but it is not a requirement to have
the same :math:`d` value in each element.

Example on piecewise quadratic finite element functions
-------------------------------------------------------

Let us set up the ``nodes`` and ``elements`` lists corresponding to the
mesh implied by Figure :ref:`fem:approx:fe:fig:P2`.
Figure :ref:`fem:approx:fe:fig:P2:mesh` sketches the mesh and the
numbering. We have

.. code-block:: python

        nodes = [0, 0.125, 0.25, 0.375, 0.5, 0.625, 0.75, 0.875, 1.0]
        elements = [[0, 1, 2], [2, 3, 4], [4, 5, 6], [6, 7, 8]]

.. _fem:approx:fe:fig:P2:mesh:

.. figure:: fe_mesh1D_P2_4e.png
   :width: 500

   *Sketch of mesh with 4 elements and 3 nodes per element*

Let us explain in mathematically how the basis functions are constructed
according to the principles.
Consider element number 1 in Figure :ref:`fem:approx:fe:fig:P2:mesh`,
:math:`\Omega^{(1)}=[0.25, 0.5]`, with local nodes
0, 1, and 2 corresponding to global nodes 2, 3, and 4.
The coordinates of these nodes are
:math:`0.25`, :math:`0.375`, and :math:`0.5`, respectively.
We define three Lagrange
polynomials on this element:

1. The polynomial that is 1 at local node 1
   (global node 3) makes up the basis function
   :math:`{\varphi}_3(x)` over this element,
   with :math:`{\varphi}_3(x)=0` outside the element.

2. The polynomial that is 1 at local node 0 (global node 2) is the "right
   part" of the global basis function
   :math:`{\varphi}_2(x)`. The "left part" of :math:`{\varphi}_2(x)` consists of
   a Lagrange polynomial associated with local node 2 in
   the neighboring element :math:`\Omega^{(0)}=[0, 0.25]`.

3. Finally, the polynomial that is 1 at local node 2 (global node 4)
   is the "left part" of the global basis function :math:`{\varphi}_4(x)`.
   The "right part" comes from the Lagrange polynomial that is 1 at
   local node 0 in the neighboring element :math:`\Omega^{(2)}=[0.5, 0.75]`.

The specific mathematical form of the polynomials *over element* 1 is
given by the formula :ref:`(4.33) <Eq:fem:approx:global:Lagrange:poly>`:

.. math::
        
        {\varphi}_3(x) &= \frac{(x-0.25)(x-0.5)}{(0.375-0.25)(0.375-0.5)},\quad x\in\Omega^{(1)}\\ 
        {\varphi}_2(x) &= \frac{(x-0.375)(x-0.5)}{(0.25-0.375)(0.25-0.5)},\quad x\in\Omega^{(1)}\\ 
        {\varphi}_4(x) &= \frac{(x-0.25)(x-0.375)}{(0.5-0.25)(0.5-0.25)},\quad x\in\Omega^{(1)}
        

As mentioned earlier, any global basis function :math:`{\varphi}_i(x)` is zero
on elements that do not contain the node with global node number :math:`i`.

The other global functions associated with internal nodes,
:math:`{\varphi}_1`, :math:`{\varphi}_5`, and :math:`{\varphi}_7`, are all of the same shape
as the drawn :math:`{\varphi}_3` in Figure :ref:`fem:approx:fe:fig:P2`, while
the global basis functions associated with shared nodes have the same
shape as shown :math:`{\varphi}_2` and :math:`{\varphi}_4`. If the elements were of
different length, the basis functions would be stretched according to
the element size and hence be different.

.. This was difficult to follow:

.. The basis function :math:`{\varphi}_2(x)`, corresponding to a node on the

.. boundary of element 0 and 1, is made up of two pieces: (i) the Lagrange

.. polynomial on element 1 that is 1 at local node 0 (global node 2)

.. and zero at all other nodes in element 1, and (ii)

.. the Lagrange

.. polynomial on element 1 that is 1 at local node 2 (global node 2)

.. and zero at all other nodes in element 0. Outside the elements that

.. share global node 2, :math:`{\varphi}_2(x)=0`. The same reasoning is applied to

.. the construction of :math:`{\varphi}_4(x)` and :math:`{\varphi}_6(x)`.

Example on piecewise linear finite element functions
----------------------------------------------------

Figure :ref:`fem:approx:fe:fig:P1` shows
piecewise linear basis functions (:math:`d=1`). These are mathematically
simpler than the quadratic functions in the previous section, and one would
therefore think that it is easier to understand the linear functions
first. However, linear basis functions do not involve internal nodes
and are therefore a special case of the general situation. That is why
we think it is better to understand the construction of quadratic functions
first, which easily generalize to any :math:`d > 2`, and then look at the
special case :math:`d=1`.

.. _fem:approx:fe:fig:P1:

.. figure:: mpl_fe_basis_p1_4e_lab.png
   :width: 600

   *Illustration of the piecewise linear basis functions associated with nodes in an element*

We have the same four elements on :math:`\Omega = [0,1]`.  Now there are no
internal nodes in the elements so that all basis functions are
associated with shared nodes and hence made up of two Lagrange
polynomials, one from each of the two neighboring elements.  For
example, :math:`{\varphi}_1(x)` results from the Lagrange polynomial in
element 0 that is 1 at local node 1 and 0 at local node 0, combined
with the Lagrange polynomial in element 1 that is 1 at local node 0
and 0 at local node 1.  The other basis functions are constructed
similarly.

Explicit mathematical formulas are needed for :math:`{\varphi}_i(x)` in
computations.  In the piecewise linear case, the formula
:ref:`(4.33) <Eq:fem:approx:global:Lagrange:poly>` leads to

.. _Eq:fem:approx:fe:phi:1:formula1:

.. math::
   :label: fem:approx:fe:phi:1:formula1
        
        {\varphi}_i(x) = \left\lbrace\begin{array}{ll}
        0, & x < x_{i-1},\\ 
        (x - x_{i-1})/(x_{i} - x_{i-1}),
        & x_{i-1} \leq x < x_{i},\\ 
        1 -
        (x - x_{i})/(x_{i+1} - x_{i}),
        & x_{i} \leq x < x_{i+1},\\ 
        0, & x\geq x_{i+1}{\thinspace .}  \end{array}
        \right.
        
        

Here, :math:`x_{j}`, :math:`j=i-1,i,i+1`, denotes the coordinate of node :math:`j`.
For elements of equal length :math:`h` the formulas can be simplified to

.. _Eq:fem:approx:fe:phi:1:formula2:

.. math::
   :label: fem:approx:fe:phi:1:formula2
        
        {\varphi}_i(x) = \left\lbrace\begin{array}{ll}
        0, & x < x_{i-1},\\ 
        (x - x_{i-1})/h,
        & x_{i-1} \leq x < x_{i},\\ 
        1 -
        (x - x_{i})/h,
        & x_{i} \leq x < x_{i+1},\\ 
        0, & x\geq x_{i+1}
        \end{array}
        \right.
        
        

Example on piecewise cubic finite element basis functions
---------------------------------------------------------

Piecewise cubic basis functions can be defined by introducing four
nodes per element. Figure :ref:`fem:approx:fe:fig:P3` shows
examples on :math:`{\varphi}_i(x)`, :math:`i=3,4,5,6`, associated with element number 1.
Note that :math:`{\varphi}_4` and :math:`{\varphi}_5` are nonzero on element number 1,
while
:math:`{\varphi}_3` and :math:`{\varphi}_6` are made up of Lagrange polynomials on two
neighboring elements.

.. _fem:approx:fe:fig:P3:

   :width: 600

   *Illustration of the piecewise cubic basis functions associated with nodes in an element*

.. index:: chapeau function

.. index:: hat function

.. index:: finite element basis function

We see that all the piecewise linear basis functions have the same
"hat" shape. They are naturally referred to as *hat functions*,
also called *chapeau functions*.
The piecewise quadratic functions in Figure :ref:`fem:approx:fe:fig:P2`
are seen to be of two types. "Rounded hats" associated with internal
nodes in the elements and some more "sombrero" shaped hats associated
with element boundary nodes. Higher-order basis functions also have
hat-like shapes, but the functions have pronounced oscillations in addition,
as illustrated in Figure :ref:`fem:approx:fe:fig:P3`.

.. index:: linear elements

.. index:: quadratic elements

.. index:: P1 element

.. index:: P2 element

A common terminology is to speak about *linear elements* as
elements with two local nodes associated with
piecewise linear basis functions. Similarly, *quadratic elements* and
*cubic elements* refer to piecewise quadratic or cubic functions
over elements with three or four local nodes, respectively.
Alternative names, frequently used in the following, are P1 elements for linear
elements, P2 for quadratic elements, and so forth: Pd signifies
degree :math:`d` of the polynomial basis functions.

.. _fem:approx:global:linearsystem:

Calculating the linear system
-----------------------------

The elements in the coefficient matrix and right-hand side are given
by the formulas :ref:`(4.5) <Eq:fem:approx:Aij>` and :ref:`(4.6) <Eq:fem:approx:bi>`, but
now the choice of :math:`{\psi}_i` is :math:`{\varphi}_i`.  Consider P1 elements
where :math:`{\varphi}_i(x)` is piecewise linear.  Nodes and elements numbered
consecutively from left to right in a uniformly partitioned mesh imply
the nodes

.. math::
         x_i=i h,\quad i=0,\ldots,N_n-1,

and the elements

.. _Eq:_auto33:

.. math::
   :label: _auto33
        
        \Omega^{(i)} = [x_{i},x_{i+1}] = [i h, (i+1)h],\quad
        i=0,\ldots,N_e-1
        {\thinspace .}
        
        

We have in this case :math:`N_e` elements and :math:`N_n=N_e+1` nodes.
The parameter :math:`N` denotes the number of unknowns in the expansion
for :math:`u`, and with the P1 elements, :math:`N=N_n-1`.
The domain is :math:`\Omega=[x_{0},x_{N}]`.
The formula for :math:`{\varphi}_i(x)` is given by
:eq:`fem:approx:fe:phi:1:formula2` and a graphical illustration is
provided in Figures :ref:`fem:approx:fe:fig:P1` and
:ref:`fem:approx:fe:fig:phi:i:im1`.

.. We clearly see

.. from the figures the very important property

.. :math:`{\varphi}_i(x){\varphi}_j(x)\neq 0` if and only if :math:`j=i-1`, :math:`j=i`, or

.. :math:`j=i+1`, or alternatively expressed, if and only if :math:`i` and :math:`j` are

.. nodes in the same element. Otherwise, :math:`{\varphi}_i` and :math:`{\varphi}_j` are

.. too distant to have an overlap and consequently their product vanishes.

   *Illustration of the piecewise linear basis functions corresponding to global node 2 and 3*

Calculating specific matrix entries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let us calculate the specific matrix entry :math:`A_{2,3} = \int_\Omega
{\varphi}_2{\varphi}_3{\, \mathrm{d}x}`. Figure :ref:`fem:approx:fe:fig:phi:2:3`
shows what :math:`{\varphi}_2` and :math:`{\varphi}_3` look like. We realize
from this figure that the product :math:`{\varphi}_2{\varphi}_3\neq 0`
only over element 2, which contains node 2 and 3.
The particular formulas for :math:`{\varphi}_{2}(x)` and :math:`{\varphi}_3(x)` on
:math:`[x_{2},x_{3}]` are found from :eq:`fem:approx:fe:phi:1:formula2`.
The function
:math:`{\varphi}_3` has positive slope over :math:`[x_{2},x_{3}]` and corresponds
to the interval :math:`[x_{i-1},x_{i}]` in
:eq:`fem:approx:fe:phi:1:formula2`. With :math:`i=3` we get

.. math::
         {\varphi}_3(x) = (x-x_2)/h,

while :math:`{\varphi}_2(x)` has negative slope over :math:`[x_{2},x_{3}]`
and corresponds to setting :math:`i=2` in :eq:`fem:approx:fe:phi:1:formula2`,

.. math::
         {\varphi}_2(x) = 1- (x-x_2)/h{\thinspace .}

We can now easily integrate,

.. math::
        
        A_{2,3} = \int_\Omega {\varphi}_2{\varphi}_{3}{\, \mathrm{d}x} =
        \int_{x_{2}}^{x_{3}}
        \left(1 - \frac{x - x_{2}}{h}\right) \frac{x - x_{2}}{h}
         {\, \mathrm{d}x} = \frac{h}{6}{\thinspace .}
        

The diagonal entry in the coefficient matrix becomes

.. math::
         A_{2,2} =
        \int_{x_{1}}^{x_{2}}
        \left(\frac{x - x_{1}}{h}\right)^2{\, \mathrm{d}x} +
        \int_{x_{2}}^{x_{3}}
        \left(1 - \frac{x - x_{2}}{h}\right)^2{\, \mathrm{d}x}
        = \frac{2h}{3}{\thinspace .}
        

The entry :math:`A_{2,1}` has an
integral that is geometrically similar to the situation in
Figure :ref:`fem:approx:fe:fig:phi:2:3`, so we get
:math:`A_{2,1}=h/6`.

Calculating a general row in the matrix
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We can now generalize the calculation of matrix entries to
a general row number :math:`i`. The entry
:math:`A_{i,i-1}=\int_\Omega{\varphi}_i{\varphi}_{i-1}{\, \mathrm{d}x}` involves
hat functions as depicted in
Figure :ref:`fem:approx:fe:fig:phi:i:im1`. Since the integral
is geometrically identical to the situation with specific nodes
2 and 3, we realize that :math:`A_{i,i-1}=A_{i,i+1}=h/6` and
:math:`A_{i,i}=2h/3`. However, we can compute the integral directly
too:

.. math::
        
        A_{i,i-1} &= \int_\Omega {\varphi}_i{\varphi}_{i-1}{\, \mathrm{d}x}\\ 
        &=
        \underbrace{\int_{x_{i-2}}^{x_{i-1}} {\varphi}_i{\varphi}_{i-1}{\, \mathrm{d}x}}_{{\varphi}_i=0} +
        \int_{x_{i-1}}^{x_{i}} {\varphi}_i{\varphi}_{i-1}{\, \mathrm{d}x} +
        \underbrace{\int_{x_{i}}^{x_{i+1}} {\varphi}_i{\varphi}_{i-1}{\, \mathrm{d}x}}_{{\varphi}_{i-1}=0}\\ 
        &= \int_{x_{i-1}}^{x_{i}}
        \underbrace{\left(\frac{x - x_{i}}{h}\right)}_{{\varphi}_i(x)}
        \underbrace{\left(1 - \frac{x - x_{i-1}}{h}\right)}_{{\varphi}_{i-1}(x)} {\, \mathrm{d}x} =
        \frac{h}{6}
        {\thinspace .}
        

The particular formulas for :math:`{\varphi}_{i-1}(x)` and :math:`{\varphi}_i(x)` on
:math:`[x_{i-1},x_{i}]` are found from :eq:`fem:approx:fe:phi:1:formula2`:
:math:`{\varphi}_i` is the linear function with positive slope, corresponding
to the interval :math:`[x_{i-1},x_{i}]` in
:eq:`fem:approx:fe:phi:1:formula2`, while :math:`\phi_{i-1}` has a
negative slope so the definition in interval
:math:`[x_{i},x_{i+1}]` in :eq:`fem:approx:fe:phi:1:formula2` must be
used.

   *Illustration of two neighboring linear (hat) functions with general node numbers*

The first and last row of the coefficient matrix lead to slightly
different integrals:

.. math::
         A_{0,0} = \int_\Omega {\varphi}_0^2{\, \mathrm{d}x} = \int_{x_{0}}^{x_{1}}
        \left(1 - \frac{x-x_0}{h}\right)^2{\, \mathrm{d}x} = \frac{h}{3}{\thinspace .}
        

Similarly, :math:`A_{N,N}` involves an integral over only one element
and hence equals :math:`h/3`.

   *Right-hand side integral with the product of a basis function and the given function to approximate*

The general formula for :math:`b_i`,
see Figure :ref:`fem:approx:fe:fig:phi:i:f`, is now easy to set up

.. _Eq:fem:approx:fe:bi:formula1:

.. math::
   :label: fem:approx:fe:bi:formula1
        
        b_i = \int_\Omega{\varphi}_i(x)f(x){\, \mathrm{d}x}
        = \int_{x_{i-1}}^{x_{i}} \frac{x - x_{i-1}}{h} f(x){\, \mathrm{d}x}
        + \int_{x_{i}}^{x_{i+1}} \left(1 - \frac{x - x_{i}}{h}\right) f(x)
        {\, \mathrm{d}x}{\thinspace .}
        
        

We need a specific :math:`f(x)` function to compute these integrals.
With :math:`f(x)=x(1-x)` and
two equal-sized elements in :math:`\Omega=[0,1]`, one gets

.. math::
        
        A = \frac{h}{6}\left(\begin{array}{ccc}
        2 & 1 & 0\\ 
        1 & 4 & 1\\ 
        0 & 1 & 2
        \end{array}\right),\quad
        b = \frac{h^2}{12}\left(\begin{array}{c}
        2 - h\\ 
        12 - 14h\\ 
        10 -17h
        \end{array}\right){\thinspace .}
        

The solution becomes

.. math::
         c_0 = \frac{h^2}{6},\quad c_1 = h - \frac{5}{6}h^2,\quad
        c_2 = 2h - \frac{23}{6}h^2{\thinspace .}  

The resulting function

.. math::
         u(x)=c_0{\varphi}_0(x) + c_1{\varphi}_1(x) + c_2{\varphi}_2(x)

is displayed in Figure :ref:`fem:approx:fe:fig:ls:P1:2:4` (left).

Assembly of elementwise computations
------------------------------------

Our integral computations so far have been straightforward. However,
with higher-degree polynomials and in higher dimensions (2D and 3D),
integrating in the physical domain gets increasingly complicated. Instead,
integrating over one element at a time, and transforming each element
to a common standardized geometry in a new reference coordinate system,
is technically easier. Almost all computer codes employ a finite element
algorithm that calculates the linear system by integrating over one
element at a time. We shall therefore explain this algorithm next.
The amount of details might be overwhelming during a first reading, but
once all those details are done right, one has a general
finite element algorithm that can be applied to all sorts of elements,
in any space dimension, no matter how geometrically complicated the domain
is.

.. index:: element matrix

The element matrix
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We start by splitting
the integral over :math:`\Omega` into a sum of contributions from
each element:

.. _Eq:fem:approx:fe:elementwise:Asplit:

.. math::
   :label: fem:approx:fe:elementwise:Asplit
        
        A_{i,j} = \int_\Omega{\varphi}_i{\varphi}_j {\, \mathrm{d}x} = \sum_{e} A^{(e)}_{i,j},\quad
        A^{(e)}_{i,j}=\int_{\Omega^{(e)}} {\varphi}_i{\varphi}_j {\, \mathrm{d}x}
        {\thinspace .}
        
        

Now, :math:`A^{(e)}_{i,j}\neq 0`, if and only if, :math:`i` and :math:`j` are nodes in element
:math:`e` (look at Figure :ref:`fem:approx:fe:fig:phi:i:im1` to realize this
property, but the result also holds for all types of elements).
Introduce :math:`i=q(e,r)` as the mapping of local node number :math:`r` in element
:math:`e` to the global node number :math:`i`. This is just a short mathematical notation
for the expression ``i=elements[e][r]`` in a program.
Let :math:`r` and :math:`s` be the local node numbers corresponding to the global
node numbers :math:`i=q(e,r)` and
:math:`j=q(e,s)`. With :math:`d` nodes per element, all the nonzero matrix entries
in :math:`A^{(e)}_{i,j}` arise from the integrals involving basis functions with
indices corresponding to the global node numbers in element number :math:`e`:

.. math::
        
        \int_{\Omega^{(e)}}{\varphi}_{q(e,r)}{\varphi}_{q(e,s)} {\, \mathrm{d}x},
        \quad r,s=0,\ldots, d{\thinspace .}
        

These contributions can be collected in a :math:`(d+1)\times (d+1)` matrix known as
the *element matrix*. Let :math:`{I_d}=\{0,\ldots,d\}` be the valid indices
of :math:`r` and :math:`s`.
We introduce the notation

.. math::
        
        \tilde A^{(e)} = \{ \tilde A^{(e)}_{r,s}\},\quad
        r,s\in{I_d},
        

for the element matrix. For P1 elements (:math:`d=1`) we have

.. math::
        
        \tilde A^{(e)} = \left\lbrack\begin{array}{ll}
        \tilde A^{(e)}_{0,0} & \tilde A^{(e)}_{0,1}\\ 
        \tilde A^{(e)}_{1,0} & \tilde A^{(e)}_{1,1}
        \end{array}\right\rbrack
        {\thinspace .}
        

while P2 elements have a :math:`3\times 3` element matrix:

.. math::
        
        \tilde A^{(e)} = \left\lbrack\begin{array}{lll}
        \tilde A^{(e)}_{0,0} & \tilde A^{(e)}_{0,1} & \tilde A^{(e)}_{0,2}\\ 
        \tilde A^{(e)}_{1,0} & \tilde A^{(e)}_{1,1} & \tilde A^{(e)}_{1,2}\\ 
        \tilde A^{(e)}_{2,0} & \tilde A^{(e)}_{2,1} & \tilde A^{(e)}_{2,2}
        \end{array}\right\rbrack
        {\thinspace .}
        

Assembly of element matrices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Given the numbers :math:`\tilde A^{(e)}_{r,s}`,
we should, according to :eq:`fem:approx:fe:elementwise:Asplit`,
add the contributions to the global coefficient matrix by

.. index:: assembly

.. _Eq:_auto34:

.. math::
   :label: _auto34
        
         A_{q(e,r),q(e,s)} := A_{q(e,r),q(e,s)} + \tilde A^{(e)}_{r,s},\quad
        r,s\in{I_d}{\thinspace .}
        
        

This process of adding in elementwise contributions to the global matrix
is called *finite element assembly* or simply *assembly*.

Figure :ref:`fem:approx:fe:fig:assembly:2x2` illustrates how element matrices
for elements with two nodes are added into the global matrix.
More specifically, the figure shows how the element matrix associated with
elements 1 and 2 assembled, assuming that global nodes are numbered
from left to right in the domain. With regularly numbered P3 elements, where
the element matrices have size :math:`4\times 4`, the assembly of elements 1 and 2
are sketched in Figure :ref:`fem:approx:fe:fig:assembly:4x4`.

Assembly of irregularly numbered elements and nodes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After assembly of element matrices corresponding to regularly numbered elements
and nodes are understood, it is wise to study the assembly process for
irregularly numbered elements and nodes. Figure :ref:`fem:approx:fe:def:elements:nodes:fig:P1:irregular` shows a mesh where the ``elements`` array, or :math:`q(e,r)`
mapping in mathematical notation, is given as

.. code-block:: python

        elements = [[2, 1], [4, 5], [0, 4], [3, 0], [5, 2]]

The associated assembly of element matrices 1 and 2 is sketched in
Figure :ref:`fem:approx:fe:fig:assembly:irr2x2`.

We have created `animations <http://tinyurl.com/opdfafk/pub/mov-approx/fe_assembly.html>`__ to illustrate the assembly of
P1 and P3 elements with regular numbering as well as P1 elements with
irregular numbering. The reader is encouraged to develop a
"geometric" understanding of how element matrix entries are added to
the global matrix. This understanding is crucial for hand
computations with the finite element method.

.. FIGURE: [fig-approx/matrix-assembly, width=600]  Illustration of matrix assembly.

The element vector
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The right-hand side of the linear system is also computed elementwise:

.. _Eq:_auto35:

.. math::
   :label: _auto35
        
        b_i = \int_\Omega f(x){\varphi}_i(x) {\, \mathrm{d}x} = \sum_{e} b^{(e)}_{i},\quad
        b^{(e)}_{i}=\int_{\Omega^{(e)}} f(x){\varphi}_i(x){\, \mathrm{d}x}
        {\thinspace .}   
        

We observe that
:math:`b_i^{(e)}\neq 0` if and only if global node :math:`i` is a node in element :math:`e`
(look at Figure :ref:`fem:approx:fe:fig:phi:i:f` to realize this property).
With :math:`d` nodes per element we can collect the :math:`d+1` nonzero contributions
:math:`b_i^{(e)}`, for :math:`i=q(e,r)`, :math:`r\in{I_d}`, in an *element vector*

.. math::
        
        \tilde b_r^{(e)}=\{ \tilde b_r^{(e)}\},\quad r\in{I_d}{\thinspace .}
        

These contributions are added to the
global right-hand side by an assembly process similar to that for the
element matrices:

.. _Eq:_auto36:

.. math::
   :label: _auto36
        
        b_{q(e,r)} := b_{q(e,r)} + \tilde b^{(e)}_{r},\quad
        r\in{I_d}{\thinspace .}   
        

.. _fem:approx:fe:mapping:

Mapping to a reference element
------------------------------

.. index:: affine mapping

.. index::
   single: mapping of reference cells; affine mapping

Instead of computing the integrals

.. math::
         \tilde A^{(e)}_{r,s} = \int_{\Omega^{(e)}}{\varphi}_{q(e,r)}(x){\varphi}_{q(e,s)}(x){\, \mathrm{d}x}

over some element
:math:`\Omega^{(e)} = [x_L, x_R]` in the physical coordinate system,
it turns out that it is considerably easier and more convenient
to map the element domain :math:`[x_L, x_R]`
to a standardized reference element domain :math:`[-1,1]` and compute all
integrals over the same domain :math:`[-1,1]`.
We have now introduced
:math:`x_L` and :math:`x_R` as the left and right boundary points of an arbitrary element.
With a natural, regular numbering of nodes and elements from left to right
through the domain, we have :math:`x_L=x_{e}` and :math:`x_R=x_{e+1}` for P1 elements.

The coordinate transformation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let :math:`X\in [-1,1]` be the coordinate
in the reference element. A linear mapping, also known as an affine mapping,
from :math:`X` to :math:`x` can be written

.. _Eq:fem:approx:fe:affine:mapping:

.. math::
   :label: fem:approx:fe:affine:mapping
        
        x = \frac{1}{2} (x_L + x_R) + \frac{1}{2} (x_R - x_L)X{\thinspace .}
        
        

This relation can alternatively be expressed as

.. _Eq:fem:approx:fe:affine:mapping2:

.. math::
   :label: fem:approx:fe:affine:mapping2
        
        x = x_m + {\frac{1}{2}}hX,
        
        

where we have introduced the element midpoint :math:`x_m=(x_L+x_R)/2` and
the element length :math:`h=x_R-x_L`.

Formulas for the element matrix and vector entries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Integrating on the reference element is a matter of just changing the
integration variable from :math:`x` to :math:`X`. Let

.. _Eq:_auto37:

.. math::
   :label: _auto37
        
        {\tilde{\varphi}}_r(X) = {\varphi}_{q(e,r)}(x(X))
        
        

be the basis function associated with local node number :math:`r` in the
reference element. Switching from :math:`x` to :math:`X` as integration variable,
using the rules from calculus, results in

.. _Eq:_auto38:

.. math::
   :label: _auto38
        
        \tilde A^{(e)}_{r,s} =
        \int_{\Omega^{(e)}}{\varphi}_{q(e,r)}(x){\varphi}_{q(e,s)}(x){\, \mathrm{d}x}
        = \int_{-1}^1 {\tilde{\varphi}}_r(X){\tilde{\varphi}}_s(X)\frac{{\, \mathrm{d}x}}{{\, \mathrm{d}X}}{\, \mathrm{d}X}
        {\thinspace .}
        
        

In 2D and 3D, :math:`{\, \mathrm{d}x}` is transformed to :math:`\hbox{det} J{\, \mathrm{d}X}`, where :math:`J` is
the Jacobian of the mapping from :math:`x` to :math:`X`. In 1D,
:math:`\hbox{det} J{\, \mathrm{d}X} = {\, \mathrm{d}x}/{\, \mathrm{d}X} = h/2`.To obtain a uniform
notation for 1D, 2D, and 3D problems we therefore replace
:math:`{\, \mathrm{d}x}/{\, \mathrm{d}X}` by :math:`\det J` already now.
The integration over the reference element is then written as

.. _Eq:fem:approx:fe:mapping:Ae:

.. math::
   :label: fem:approx:fe:mapping:Ae
        
        \tilde A^{(e)}_{r,s}
        = \int_{-1}^1 {\tilde{\varphi}}_r(X){\tilde{\varphi}}_s(X)\det J\,{\, \mathrm{d}X}
        
        {\thinspace .}
        

The corresponding formula for the element vector entries becomes

.. _Eq:fem:approx:fe:mapping:be:

.. math::
   :label: fem:approx:fe:mapping:be
        
        \tilde b^{(e)}_{r} = \int_{\Omega^{(e)}}f(x){\varphi}_{q(e,r)}(x){\, \mathrm{d}x}
        = \int_{-1}^1 f(x(X)){\tilde{\varphi}}_r(X)\det J\,{\, \mathrm{d}X}
        
        {\thinspace .}
        


.. admonition:: Why reference elements

   The great advantage of using reference elements is that
   the formulas for the basis functions, :math:`{\tilde{\varphi}}_r(X)`, are the
   same for all elements and independent of the element geometry
   (length and location in the mesh). The geometric information
   is "factored out" in the simple mapping formula and the associated
   :math:`\det J` quantity. Also, the integration domain is the same for
   all elements. All these features contribute to simplify computer
   codes and make them more general.




.. Since we from now on will work in the reference

.. element, we need explicit mathematical formulas for the basis

.. functions :math:`{\varphi}_i(x)` in the reference element only, i.e., we only need

.. to specify formulas for :math:`{\tilde{\varphi}}_r(X)`.

Formulas for local basis functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :math:`{\tilde{\varphi}}_r(x)` functions are simply the Lagrange
polynomials defined through the local nodes in the reference element.

polynomials

In general,

.. _Eq:_auto39:

where :math:`X_{(0)},\ldots,X_{(d)}` are the coordinates of the local nodes in
the reference element.
These are normally uniformly spaced: :math:`X_{(r)} = -1 + 2r/d`,
:math:`r\in{I_d}`.

Example: Integration over a reference element
---------------------------------------------

To illustrate the concepts from the previous section in a specific
example, we now
consider calculation of the element matrix and vector for a specific choice of
:math:`d` and :math:`f(x)`. A simple choice is :math:`d=1` (P1 elements) and :math:`f(x)=x(1-x)`
on :math:`\Omega =[0,1]`. We have the general expressions
:eq:`fem:approx:fe:mapping:Ae` and :eq:`fem:approx:fe:mapping:be`
for :math:`\tilde A^{(e)}_{r,s}` and :math:`\tilde b^{(e)}_{r}`.
Writing these out for the choices :eq:`fem:approx:fe:mapping:P1:phi0`
and :eq:`fem:approx:fe:mapping:P1:phi1`, and using that :math:`\det J = h/2`,
we can do the following calculations of the element matrix entries:

In the last two expressions we have used the element midpoint :math:`x_m`.

Integration of lower-degree polynomials above is tedious,
and higher-degree polynomials involve much more algebra, but ``sympy``
may help. For example, we can easily calculate
:eq:`fem:approx:fe:intg:ref:Ae00`,
:eq:`fem:approx:fe:intg:ref:Ae10`,
and :eq:`fem:approx:fe:intg:ref:be0` by

.. code-block:: ipy

        >>> import sympy as sym
        >>> x, x_m, h, X = sym.symbols('x x_m h X')
        >>> sym.integrate(h/8*(1-X)**2, (X, -1, 1))
        h/3
        >>> sym.integrate(h/8*(1+X)*(1-X), (X, -1, 1))
        h/6
        >>> x = x_m + h/2*X
        >>> b_0 = sym.integrate(h/4*x*(1-x)*(1-X), (X, -1, 1))
        >>> print b_0
        -h**3/24 + h**2*x_m/6 - h**2/12 - h*x_m**2/2 + h*x_m/2
