Comparison of finite element and finite difference approximations
=================================================================

The previous sections on approximating :math:`f` by a finite element function :math:`u`
utilize the projection/Galerkin or
least squares approaches to minimize the approximation
error. We may, alternatively, use the collocation/interpolation method
as described in the section :ref:`fem:approx:fe:impl:ex1:collocation`.
Here we shall compare these three approaches with what one does in
the finite difference method when representing a given function on a mesh.

.. _fem:approx:fe:fd:fdproj:

Finite difference approximation of given functions
--------------------------------------------------

Approximating a given function :math:`f(x)` on a mesh in a finite difference
context will typically just sample :math:`f` at the mesh points. If :math:`u_i`
is the value of the approximate :math:`u` at the mesh point :math:`x_{i}`, we have
:math:`u_i = f(x_{i})`.
The collocation/interpolation method using finite element basis
functions gives exactly the same representation,
as shown the section :ref:`fem:approx:fe:impl:ex1:collocation`,

.. math::
         u(x_{i}) = c_i = f(x_{i}){\thinspace .}

How does a finite element Galerkin or least squares approximation differ
from this straightforward interpolation of :math:`f`? This is the question
to be addressed next.
We now limit the scope to P1 elements since this is the element type
that gives formulas closest to those arising in the finite difference
method.

.. _fem:approx:fe:fd:feproj:

Finite difference interpretation of a finite element approximation
------------------------------------------------------------------

The linear system arising from a Galerkin or least squares approximation
reads in general

.. math::
        
        \sum_{j\in{\mathcal{I}_s}} c_j ({\psi}_i,{\psi}_j) = (f,{\psi}_i),\quad i\in{\mathcal{I}_s}{\thinspace .}
        

In the finite element approximation we choose :math:`{\psi}_i ={\varphi}_i`.
With :math:`{\varphi}_i` corresponding to P1 elements and a uniform mesh of
element length :math:`h` we have in the section :ref:`fem:approx:global:linearsystem` calculated the matrix with entries
:math:`({\varphi}_i,{\varphi}_j)`.  Equation number :math:`i` reads

.. _Eq:fem:deq:1D:approx:deq:massmat:diffeq2:

.. math::
   :label: fem:deq:1D:approx:deq:massmat:diffeq2
        
        \frac{h}{6}(u_{i-1} + 4u_i + u_{i+1}) = (f,{\varphi}_i)
        {\thinspace .}
        
        

The first and last equation, corresponding to :math:`i=0` and :math:`i=N` are slightly
different, see the section :ref:`fem:approx:fe:A:structure`.

The finite difference counterpart to
:eq:`fem:deq:1D:approx:deq:massmat:diffeq2` is just :math:`u_i=f_i`
as explained in the section :ref:`fem:approx:fe:fd:fdproj`.
To easier compare this result to
the finite element approach to approximating functions, we can rewrite
the left-hand side of :eq:`fem:deq:1D:approx:deq:massmat:diffeq2`
as

.. math::
        
        h(u_i + \frac{1}{6}(u_{i-1} - 2u_i + u_{i+1}))
        {\thinspace .}
        

Thinking in terms of finite differences, we can write this expression
using finite difference operator notation:

.. math::
         [h(u + \frac{h^2}{6}D_x D_x u)]_i,

which is nothing but the standard discretization of

.. math::
         h(u + \frac{h^2}{6}u''){\thinspace .}

Before interpreting the approximation procedure as solving a
differential equation, we need to work out what the right-hand side is
in the context of P1 elements.
Since :math:`{\varphi}_i` is the linear function that is 1 at
:math:`x_{i}` and zero at all other nodes, only the interval :math:`[x_{i-1},x_{i+1}]`
contribute to the integral on the right-hand side. This integral is
naturally split into two parts according to
:ref:`(5.3) <Eq:fem:approx:fe:phi:1:formula2>`:

.. math::
         (f,{\varphi}_i) = \int_{x_{i-1}}^{x_{i}} f(x)\frac{1}{h} (x - x_{i-1}) {\, \mathrm{d}x}
        + \int_{x_{i}}^{x_{i+1}} f(x)(1 - \frac{1}{h}(x - x_{i})) {\, \mathrm{d}x}
        {\thinspace .}
        

However, if :math:`f` is not known we cannot do much else with this expression.
It is clear that many values of
:math:`f` around :math:`x_{i}` contribute to the right-hand side, not just
the single point value :math:`f(x_{i})`
as in the finite difference method.

To proceed with the right-hand side, we can
turn to numerical integration schemes.
The Trapezoidal method for :math:`(f,{\varphi}_i)`, based on
sampling the integrand :math:`f{\varphi}_i` at the node points :math:`x_{i}=i h`
gives

.. math::
         (f,{\varphi}_i) = \int_\Omega f{\varphi}_i {\, \mathrm{d}x}\approx h\frac{1}{2}(
        f(x_{0}){\varphi}_i(x_{0}) + f(x_{N}){\varphi}_i(x_{N}))
        + h\sum_{j=1}^{N-1} f(x_{j}){\varphi}_i(x_{j})
        {\thinspace .}
        

Since :math:`{\varphi}_i` is zero at all these points, except at :math:`x_{i}`, the
Trapezoidal rule collapses to one term:

.. math::
        
        (f,{\varphi}_i) \approx hf(x_{i}),
        

for :math:`i=1,\ldots,N-1`,
which is the same result as with collocation/interpolation, and of course
the same result as in the finite difference method.
For the end points
:math:`i=0` and :math:`i=N` we get contribution from only one element so

.. math::
        
        (f,{\varphi}_i) \approx {\frac{1}{2}}hf(x_{i}),\quad i=0,\ i=N
        {\thinspace .}
        

Simpson's rule with sample points also in the middle of
the elements, at :math:`x_{i+\frac{1}{2}}=(x_{i} + x_{i+1})/2`,
can be written as

.. math::
         \int_\Omega g(x){\, \mathrm{d}x} \approx \frac{\tilde h}{3}\left( g(x_{0}) +
        2\sum_{j=1}^{N-1} g(x_{j})
        + 4\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} g(x_{j+\frac{1}{2}}) + f(x_{2N})\right),
        

where :math:`\tilde h= h/2` is the spacing between the sample points.
Our integrand is :math:`g=f{\varphi}_i`. For all the node points,
:math:`{\varphi}_i(x_{j})=\delta_{ij}`, and therefore
:math:`\sum_{j=1}^{N-1} f(x_{j}){\varphi}_i(x_{j})=f(x_{i})`.
At the midpoints, :math:`{\varphi}_i(x_{i\pm\frac{1}{2}})=1/2` and
:math:`{\varphi}_i(x_{j+\frac{1}{2}})=0` for :math:`j>1` and :math:`j<i-1`.
Consequently,

.. math::
         \sum_{j=0}^{N-1} f(x_{j+\frac{1}{2}}){\varphi}_i(x_{j+\frac{1}{2}})
        = \frac{1}{2}(fx_{j-\frac{1}{2}} + x_{j+\frac{1}{2}}){\thinspace .}

When :math:`1\leq i\leq N-1` we then get

.. math::
        
        (f,{\varphi}_i) \approx
        \frac{h}{3}(f_{i-\frac{1}{2}} + f_i + f_{i+\frac{1}{2}})
        {\thinspace .}
        

This result shows that, with Simpson's rule, the finite element method
operates with the average of :math:`f` over three points, while the finite difference
method just applies :math:`f` at one point. We may interpret this as
a "smearing" or smoothing of :math:`f` by the finite element method.

We can now summarize our findings. With the approximation of
:math:`(f,{\varphi}_i)` by the Trapezoidal rule, P1 elements give rise
to equations that can be expressed as a finite difference
discretization of

.. math::
        
        u + \frac{h^2}{6} u'' = f,\quad u'(0)=u'(L)=0,
        

expressed with operator notation as

.. math::
        
        [u + \frac{h^2}{6} D_x D_x u = f]_i{\thinspace .}  

As :math:`h\rightarrow 0`, the extra term proportional to :math:`u''` goes to zero,
and the two methods are then equal.

With the Simpson's rule, we may say that we solve

.. math::
        
        [u + \frac{h^2}{6} D_x D_x u = \bar f]_i,
        

where :math:`\bar f_i` means the average :math:`\frac{1}{3}(f_{i-1/2} + f_i + f_{i+1/2})`.

The extra term :math:`\frac{h^2}{6} u''` represents a smoothing effect: with
just this term, we would find :math:`u` by integrating :math:`f` twice and thereby
smooth :math:`f` considerably. In addition, the finite element
representation of :math:`f` involves an average, or a smoothing, of :math:`f` on
the right-hand side of the equation system. If :math:`f` is a noisy
function, direct interpolation :math:`u_i=f_i` may result in a noisy :math:`u`
too, but with a Galerkin or least squares formulation and P1 elements,
we should expect that :math:`u` is smoother than :math:`f` unless :math:`h` is very
small.

The interpretation that finite elements tend to smooth the solution
is valid in applications far beyond approximation of 1D functions.

Making finite elements behave as finite differences
---------------------------------------------------

With a simple trick, using numerical integration, we can easily produce
the result :math:`u_i=f_i` with the Galerkin or least square formulation
with P1 elements. This is useful in many occasions when we deal
with more difficult differential equations and want the finite element
method to have properties like the finite difference method (solving
standard linear wave equations is one primary example).

Computations in physical space
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We have already seen that applying the Trapezoidal rule to the
right-hand side :math:`(f,{\varphi}_i)` simply gives :math:`f` sampled at :math:`x_{i}`.
Using the Trapezoidal rule on the  matrix entries
:math:`A_{i,j}=({\varphi}_i,{\varphi}_j)` involves a sum

.. math::
         \sum_k {\varphi}_i(x_{k}){\varphi}_j(x_{k}),

but :math:`{\varphi}_i(x_{k})=\delta_{ik}` and
:math:`{\varphi}_j(x_{k})=\delta_{jk}`.
The product :math:`{\varphi}_i{\varphi}_j` is then different from zero only
when sampled at :math:`x_{i}` and :math:`i=j`. The Trapezoidal
approximation to the integral
is then

.. math::
         ({\varphi}_i,{\varphi}_j) \approx h,\quad i=j,

and zero if :math:`i\neq j`. This means that we have obtained a diagonal matrix!
The first and last diagonal elements, :math:`({\varphi}_0,{\varphi}_0)` and
:math:`({\varphi}_N,{\varphi}_N)` get contribution only from the first and last
element, respectively, resulting in the approximate integral value :math:`h/2`.
The corresponding right-hand side also has a factor :math:`1/2` for :math:`i=0` and :math:`i=N`.
Therefore, the least squares or Galerkin approach with P1 elements and
Trapezoidal integration results in

.. math::
         c_i = f_i,\quad i\in{\mathcal{I}_s}{\thinspace .}  

Simpsons's rule can be used to achieve a similar result for P2 elements, i.e,
a diagonal coefficient matrix, but with the previously derived
average of :math:`f` on the right-hand side.

Elementwise computations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Identical results to those above will arise if we perform elementwise
computations. The idea is to use the Trapezoidal rule on the reference
element for computing the element matrix and vector. When assembled,
the same equations :math:`c_i=f(x_{i})` arise. :ref:`fem:approx:fe:exer:1D:trapez` encourages you to carry out the
details.

Terminology
~~~~~~~~~~~

The matrix with entries :math:`({\varphi}_i,{\varphi}_j)` typically arises from
terms proportional to :math:`u` in a differential equation where :math:`u` is the
unknown function. This matrix is often called the *mass matrix*,
because in the early days of the finite element method, the matrix
arose from the mass times acceleration term in Newton's second law of
motion. Making the mass matrix diagonal by, e.g., numerical
integration, as demonstrated above, is a widely used technique and is
called *mass lumping*. In time-dependent problems it can sometimes
enhance the numerical accuracy and computational efficiency of the
finite element method.  However, there are also examples where mass
lumping destroys accuracy.
