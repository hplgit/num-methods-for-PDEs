<span class="target" id="index-0"></span><p id="index-1">Our model problem is perhaps the simplest ordinary differential
equation (ODE):</p>
<div class="math">
\[u^{\prime}(t) = -au(t),\]</div>
<p>Here, <span class="math">\(a&gt;0\)</span> is a constant and <span class="math">\(u^{\prime}(t)\)</span> means differentiation with
respect to time <span class="math">\(t\)</span>. This type of equation arises in a number of
widely different phenomena where some quantity <span class="math">\(u\)</span> undergoes
exponential reduction. Examples include radioactive decay, population
decay, investment decay, cooling of an object, pressure decay in the
atmosphere, and retarded motion in fluids (for some of these models,
<span class="math">\(a\)</span> can be negative as well), see the section <a class="reference internal" href="._main_decay006.html#decay-app"><em>Applications of exponential decay models</em></a> for details
and motivation.  We have chosen this particular ODE not only because
its applications are relevant, but even more because studying
numerical solution methods for this simple ODE gives important insight
that can be reused in much more complicated settings, in particular
when solving diffusion-type partial differential equations.</p>
<p>The analytical solution of the ODE is found by the method of
separation of variables, which results in</p>
<div class="math">
\[u(t) = Ce^{-at},\]</div>
<p>for any arbitrary constant <span class="math">\(C\)</span>.
To formulate a mathematical problem for which there
is a unique solution, we need a condition to fix the value of <span class="math">\(C\)</span>.
This condition is known as the <em>initial condition</em> and stated as
<span class="math">\(u(0)=I\)</span>. That is, we know the
value <span class="math">\(I\)</span> of <span class="math">\(u\)</span> when the process starts at <span class="math">\(t=0\)</span>. The exact solution
is then <span class="math">\(u(t)=Ie^{-at}\)</span>.</p>
<p>We seek the solution <span class="math">\(u(t)\)</span> of the ODE for <span class="math">\(t\in (0,T]\)</span>. The point <span class="math">\(t=0\)</span> is not
included since we know <span class="math">\(u\)</span> here and assume that the equation governs
<span class="math">\(u\)</span> for <span class="math">\(t&gt;0\)</span>. The complete ODE problem then reads: find <span class="math">\(u(t)\)</span>
such that</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-decay:problem">
<span id="eq-decay-problem"></span><span class="eqno">(1)</span>\[     u^{\prime} = -au,\ t\in (0,T], \quad u(0)=I{\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>This is known as a <em>continuous problem</em> because the parameter <span class="math">\(t\)</span>
varies continuously from <span class="math">\(0\)</span> to <span class="math">\(T\)</span>. For each <span class="math">\(t\)</span> we have a corresponding
<span class="math">\(u(t)\)</span>. There are hence infinitely many values of <span class="math">\(t\)</span> and <span class="math">\(u(t)\)</span>.
The purpose of a numerical method is to formulate a corresponding
<em>discrete</em> problem whose solution is characterized by a finite number of values,
which can be computed in a finite number of steps on a computer.</p>

<span id="decay-schemes-fe"></span><h2>The Forward Euler scheme<a class="headerlink" href="#the-forward-euler-scheme" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Solving an ODE like <a href="#equation-decay:problem">(1)</a> by a finite difference method
consists of the following four steps:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>discretizing the domain,</li>
<li>fulfilling the equation at discrete time points,</li>
<li>replacing derivatives by finite differences,</li>
<li>formulating a recursive algorithm.</li>
</ol>
<span class="target" id="index-2"></span><div class="section" id="step-1-discretizing-the-domain">
<span id="index-3"></span><h3>Step 1: Discretizing the domain<a class="headerlink" href="#step-1-discretizing-the-domain" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The time domain <span class="math">\([0,T]\)</span> is represented by a finite number of
<span class="math">\(N_t+1\)</span> points</p>
<div class="math">
\[\begin{split}0 = t_0 &lt; t_1 &lt; t_2 &lt; \cdots &lt; t_{N_t-1} &lt; t_{N_t} = T{\thinspace .}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>The collection of points <span class="math">\(t_0,t_1,\ldots,t_{N_t}\)</span> constitutes a <em>mesh</em>
or <em>grid</em>. Often the mesh points will be uniformly spaced in
the domain <span class="math">\([0,T]\)</span>, which means that the spacing <span class="math">\(t_{n+1}-t_n\)</span> is
the same for all <span class="math">\(n\)</span>. This spacing is often denoted by <span class="math">\(\Delta t\)</span>,
in this case <span class="math">\(t_n=n\Delta t\)</span>.</p>
<p id="index-4">We seek the solution <span class="math">\(u\)</span> at the mesh points:
<span class="math">\(u(t_n)\)</span>, <span class="math">\(n=1,2,\ldots,N_t\)</span>. Note that <span class="math">\(u^0\)</span> is already known as <span class="math">\(I\)</span>.
A notational short-form for <span class="math">\(u(t_n)\)</span>,
which will be used extensively, is <span class="math">\(u^{n}\)</span>. More precisely, we let
<span class="math">\(u^n\)</span> be the <em>numerical approximation</em> to the exact solution <span class="math">\(u(t_n)\)</span>
at <span class="math">\(t=t_n\)</span>. The numerical approximation is a <em>mesh function</em>,
here defined only at the mesh points.
When we need to clearly distinguish between the numerical
and the exact solution, we often place a subscript e on the exact
solution, as in <span class="math">\({u_{\small\mbox{e}}}(t_n)\)</span>. Figure <a class="reference internal" href="#decay-fdu-e"><em>Time mesh with discrete solution values</em></a> shows the
<span class="math">\(t_n\)</span> and <span class="math">\(u_n\)</span> points for <span class="math">\(n=0,1,\ldots,N_t=7\)</span> as well as <span class="math">\({u_{\small\mbox{e}}}(t)\)</span>
as the dashed line. The goal of a numerical method for ODEs is
to compute the mesh function by solving a finite set of
<em>algebraic equations</em> derived from the original ODE problem.</p>

<p class="caption"><em>Time mesh with discrete solution values</em></p>
</div>
<p>Since finite difference methods produce solutions at the mesh
points only, it is an open question what the solution is between
the mesh points. One can use methods for interpolation to
compute the value of <span class="math">\(u\)</span> between mesh points. The simplest
(and most widely used) interpolation method is to assume that
<span class="math">\(u\)</span> varies linearly between the mesh points, see
Figure <a class="reference internal" href="#decay-fdu-ei"><em>Linear interpolation between the discrete solution values (dashed curve is exact solution)</em></a>. Given <span class="math">\(u^{n}\)</span>
and <span class="math">\(u^{n+1}\)</span>, the value of <span class="math">\(u\)</span> at some <span class="math">\(t\in [t_{n}, t_{n+1}]\)</span>
is by linear interpolation</p>

<h3>Step 2: Fulfilling the equation at discrete time points<a class="headerlink" href="#step-2-fulfilling-the-equation-at-discrete-time-points" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The ODE is supposed to hold for all <span class="math">\(t\in (0,T]\)</span>, i.e., at an infinite
number of points. Now we relax that requirement and require that
the ODE is fulfilled at a finite set of discrete points in time.
The mesh points <span class="math">\(t_0,t_1,\ldots,t_{N_t}\)</span> are a natural
(but not the only) choice of points.
The original ODE is then reduced to  the following <span class="math">\(N_t\)</span> equations:</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-decay:step2">
<span id="eq-decay-step2"></span><span class="eqno">(2)</span>\[     u^{\prime}(t_n) = -au(t_n),\quad n=0,\ldots,N_t{\thinspace .}\]</div>

<span id="index-5"></span><h3>Step 3: Replacing derivatives by finite differences<a class="headerlink" href="#step-3-replacing-derivatives-by-finite-differences" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The next and most essential step of the method is to replace the
derivative <span class="math">\(u^{\prime}\)</span> by a finite difference approximation. Let us first
try a one-sided difference approximation (see Figure <a class="reference internal" href="#decay-sketch-fe"><em>Illustration of a forward difference</em></a>),</p>
<span class="target" id="index-6"></span><div class="math" id="equation-decay:FEdiff">

<p>Inserting this approximation in <a href="#equation-decay:step2">(2)</a> results in</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-decay:step3">
<span id="eq-decay-step3"></span><span class="eqno">(4)</span>\[     \frac{u^{n+1}-u^{n}}{t_{n+1}-t_n} = -au^{n},\quad n=0,1,\ldots,N_t-1{\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>Later it will be absolutely clear that if we want to compute the solution
up to time level <span class="math">\(N_t\)</span>,
we only need <a href="#equation-decay:step2">(2)</a> to hold for <span class="math">\(n=0,\ldots,N_t-1\)</span> since
<a href="#equation-decay:step3">(4)</a> for <span class="math">\(n=N_t-1\)</span> creates an equation for the final
value <span class="math">\(u^{N_t}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Equation <a href="#equation-decay:step3">(4)</a>
is the discrete counterpart to the original ODE problem
<a href="#equation-decay:problem">(1)</a>, and often referred to as <em>finite difference scheme</em>
or more generally as the <em>discrete equations</em> of the problem.
The fundamental feature of these equations is that they are <em>algebraic</em>
and can hence be straightforwardly solved to produce the mesh function, i.e.,
the values of <span class="math">\(u\)</span> at
the mesh points (<span class="math">\(u^n\)</span>, <span class="math">\(n=1,2,\ldots,N_t\)</span>).</p>

<span id="index-12"></span><h3>Step 4: Formulating a recursive algorithm<a class="headerlink" href="#step-4-formulating-a-recursive-algorithm" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The final step is to identify the computational algorithm to be implemented
in a program. The key observation here is to realize that
<a href="#equation-decay:step3">(4)</a> can be used to compute <span class="math">\(u^{n+1}\)</span> if <span class="math">\(u^n\)</span> is known.
Starting with <span class="math">\(n=0\)</span>, <span class="math">\(u^0\)</span> is known since <span class="math">\(u^0=u(0)=I\)</span>, and
<a href="#equation-decay:step3">(4)</a> gives an equation for <span class="math">\(u^1\)</span>. Knowing <span class="math">\(u^1\)</span>,
<span class="math">\(u^2\)</span> can be found from <a href="#equation-decay:step3">(4)</a>. In general, <span class="math">\(u^n\)</span>
in <a href="#equation-decay:step3">(4)</a> can be assumed known, and then we can easily solve for
the unknown <span class="math">\(u^{n+1}\)</span>:</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-decay:FE">
<span id="eq-decay-fe"></span><span class="eqno">(5)</span>\[     u^{n+1} = u^n - a(t_{n+1} -t_n)u^n{\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>We shall refer to <a href="#equation-decay:FE">(5)</a> as the Forward Euler (FE) scheme
for our model problem. From a mathematical point of view,
equations of the form <a href="#equation-decay:FE">(5)</a> are known as
<em>difference equations</em> since they express how differences in
<span class="math">\(u\)</span>, like <span class="math">\(u^{n+1}-u^n\)</span>, evolve with <span class="math">\(n\)</span>.
The finite difference method can be viewed as a method for turning
a differential equation into a difference equation.</p>
<p>Computation with <a href="#equation-decay:FE">(5)</a> is straightforward:</p>
<div class="math">
\[\begin{split}u_0 &amp;= I,\\
u_1 &amp; = u^0 - a(t_{1} -t_0)u^0 = I(1-a(t_1-t_0)),\\
u_2 &amp; = u^1 - a(t_{2} -t_1)u^1 = I(1-a(t_1-t_0))(1 - a(t_2-t_1)),\\
u^3 &amp;= u^2 - a(t_{3} -t_2)u^2 = I(1-a(t_1-t_0))(1 - a(t_2-t_1))(1 - a(t_3-t_2)),\end{split}\]</div>
<p>and so on until we reach <span class="math">\(u^{N_t}\)</span>.
Very often, <span class="math">\(t_{n+1}-t_n\)</span> is constant for all <span class="math">\(n\)</span>, so we can introduce
the common symbol <span class="math">\(\Delta t\)</span> for the time step:
<span class="math">\(\Delta t = t_{n+1}-t_n\)</span>, <span class="math">\(n=0,1,\ldots,N_t-1\)</span>.
Using a constant time step <span class="math">\(\Delta t\)</span> in the above calculations gives</p>
<div class="math">
\[\begin{split}u_0 &amp;= I,\\
u_1 &amp; = I(1-a\Delta t),\\
u_2 &amp; = I(1-a\Delta t)^2,\\
u^3 &amp;= I(1-a\Delta t)^3,\\
&amp;\vdots\\
u^{N_t} &amp;= I(1-a\Delta t)^{N_t}{\thinspace .}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>This means that we have found a closed formula for <span class="math">\(u^n\)</span>, and there is
no need to let a computer generate the sequence <span class="math">\(u^1, u^2, u^3, \ldots\)</span>.
However, finding such a formula for <span class="math">\(u^n\)</span> is possible only for a few very
simple problems, so in general finite difference equations must be
solved on a computer.</p>
<p>As the next sections will show, the scheme <a href="#equation-decay:FE">(5)</a> is just one
out of many alternative finite difference (and other) methods for
the model problem <a href="#equation-decay:problem">(1)</a>.</p>

<p>The finite difference formulas for approximating the first derivative
of a function have so far been somewhat justified through graphical
illustrations in Figures <a class="reference internal" href="#decay-sketch-fe"><em>Illustration of a forward difference</em></a>, <a class="reference internal" href="#decay-sketch-be"><em>Illustration of a backward difference</em></a>,
and <a class="reference internal" href="#decay-sketch-cn"><em>Illustration of a centered difference</em></a>. The task is to approximate the derivative
at a point of a curve using only two function values. By drawing
a straight line through the points, we have some approximation to
the tangent of the curve and use the slope of this line as
an approximation to the derivative. The slope can be computed by
inspecting the figures.</p>
<p>However, we can also derive the finite difference formulas by
pure mathematics too. The key tool for this approach is Taylor series,
or more precisely, approximation of functions by lower-order
Taylor polynomials. Given a function <span class="math">\(f(x)\)</span> with &#8220;enough derivatives&#8221;,
a Taylor polynomial of degree <span class="math">\(m\)</span> can be used to approximate the
value of the function <span class="math">\(f(x)\)</span> if we know the values of <span class="math">\(f\)</span> and its
first <span class="math">\(m\)</span> derivatives at some point <span class="math">\(x=a\)</span>. The formula for the
Taylor polynomial reads</p>
<div class="math">
\[f(x) \approx f(a) + f'(a)(x-a) + \frac{1}{2}f''(a)(x-a)^2 +
\frac{1}{6}f'''(a)(x-a)^3\cdots +
\frac{1}{m!}\frac{f^{(m)}}{x^m}(a)(x-a)^m{\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>For a function of time, <span class="math">\(f(t)\)</span>, related to a mesh with spacing <span class="math">\(\Delta t\)</span>,
we often need the Taylor polynomial approximation at <span class="math">\(f(t_n\pm\Delta t)\)</span>

<span class="target" id="index-24"></span><p id="index-25">Finite difference formulas can be tedious to write and read,
especially for differential equations with many terms and many
derivatives. To save space and help the reader of the scheme to quickly
see the nature of the difference approximations, we introduce a
compact notation. A forward difference approximation is denoted
by the <span class="math">\(D_t^+\)</span> operator:</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-fd:D:f">
<span id="eq-fd-d-f"></span><span class="eqno">(30)</span>\[     [D_t^+u]^n = \frac{u^{n+1} - u^{n}}{\Delta t}

<p>The notation consists of an operator that approximates
differentiation with respect to an independent variable, here <span class="math">\(t\)</span>.
The operator is built of the symbol <span class="math">\(D\)</span>, with the variable as subscript
and a superscript denoting the type of difference. The superscript <span class="math">\(\,{}^+\)</span>
indicates a forward difference.
We place square brackets around the operator and the function it operates
on and specify the mesh point, where the operator is acting, by
a superscript.</p>

a backward difference reads</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-fd:D:c">

<p>The superscript <span class="math">\(t\)</span> indicates that the average is taken along the time
coordinate. The common average <span class="math">\((u^n + u^{n+1})/2\)</span> can now be
expressed as <span class="math">\([\overline{u}^{t}]^{n+\frac{1}{2}}\)</span>. (When also spatial coordinates

<span id="eq-decay-fd1-du-theta"></span><span class="eqno">(36)</span>\[     \lbrack\bar D_t u\rbrack^{n+\theta} = \frac{u^{n+1}-u^n}{t^{n+1}-t^n},\]</div>
<p>and a <em>weighted averaging operator</em></p>
<div class="math" id="equation-decay:fd1:wmean:a">
<span id="eq-decay-fd1-wmean-a"></span><span class="eqno">(37)</span>\[     \lbrack\overline{u}^{t,\theta}\rbrack^{n+\theta} = (1-\theta)u^{n} + \theta u^{n+1}
     \approx u(t_{n+\theta}),\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(\theta\in [0,1]\)</span>. Note that for <span class="math">\(\theta =\frac{1}{2}\)</span> we recover
the standard centered difference and the standard arithmetic mean.
The idea in <a href="#equation-decay:fd1:op:theta">(35)</a> is to sample the equation at
<span class="math">\(t_{n+\theta}\)</span>, use a skew difference at that
point <span class="math">\([\bar D_t u]^{n+\theta}\)</span>, and a skew mean value.
An alternative notation is</p>
<div class="math">
\[[D_t u]^{n+\frac{1}{2}} = \theta [-au]^{n+1} + (1-\theta)[-au]^{n}{\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>Looking at the various examples above and comparing them with the
underlying differential equations, we see immediately which difference
approximations that have been used and at which point they
apply. Therefore, the compact notation effectively communicates the
reasoning behind turning a differential equation into a difference
equation.</p>
