<p>This section presents many mathematical models that all
end up with ODEs of the type <span class="math">\(u^{\prime}=-au+b\)</span>.
The applications are taken from biology,
finance, and physics, and cover population growth or decay, compound
interest and inflation, radioactive decay, cooling of objects,
compaction of geological media, pressure
variations in the atmosphere, and air resistance on falling or rising
bodies.</p>
<div class="section" id="scaling-1">
<span id="decay-app-scaling"></span><h2>Scaling  (1)<a class="headerlink" href="#scaling-1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Real applications of a model <span class="math">\(u^{\prime}=-au+b\)</span> will often involve a lot
of parameters in the expressions for <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span>. It can be quite
a challenge to find relevant values of all parameters. In simple
problems, however, it turns out that it is not always necessary
to estimate all parameters because we can lump them into one or
a few <em>dimensionless</em> numbers by using a very attractive technique
called scaling. It simply means to stretch the <span class="math">\(u\)</span> and <span class="math">\(t\)</span> axis
is the present problem - and suddenly all parameters in the problem
are lumped one parameter if <span class="math">\(b\neq 0\)</span> and no parameter when <span class="math">\(b=0\)</span>!</p>
<p>Scaling means that we introduce a new function <span class="math">\(\bar u(\bar t)\)</span>,
with</p>
<div class="math">
\[\bar u = \frac{u - u_m}{u_c},\quad \bar t = \frac{t}{t_c},\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(u_m\)</span> is a characteristic value of <span class="math">\(u\)</span>, <span class="math">\(u_c\)</span> is a characteristic
size of the range of <span class="math">\(u\)</span> values, and <span class="math">\(t_c\)</span> is a characteristic
size of the range of <span class="math">\(t_c\)</span> where <span class="math">\(u\)</span> varies significantly.
Choosing <span class="math">\(u_m\)</span>, <span class="math">\(u_c\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(t_c\)</span> is not always easy and often an art
in complicated problems. We just state one choice first:</p>
<div class="math">
\[u_c = I,\quad u_m = b/a,\quad t_c = 1/a{\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>Inserting <span class="math">\(u=u_m + u_c\bar u\)</span> and <span class="math">\(t=t_c\bar t\)</span> in the problem
<span class="math">\(u^{\prime}=-au + b\)</span>, assuming <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span> are constants, results after some
algebra in the <em>scaled problem</em></p>
<div class="math">
\[\frac{d\bar u}{d\bar t} = -\bar u,\quad \bar u(0)=1 - \beta,\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(\beta\)</span> is a dimensionless number</p>
<div class="math">
\[\beta = \frac{b}{Ia}{\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>That is, only the special combination of <span class="math">\(b/(Ia)\)</span> matters, not what
the individual values of <span class="math">\(b\)</span>, <span class="math">\(a\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(I\)</span> are. Moreover, if <span class="math">\(b=0\)</span>,
the scaled problem is independent of <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(I\)</span>! In practice this means
that we can perform one numerical simulation of the scaled problem and
recover the solution of any problem for a given <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(I\)</span> by
stretching the axis in the plot: <span class="math">\(u=I\bar u\)</span> and <span class="math">\(t =\bar t/a\)</span>.
For <span class="math">\(b\neq 0\)</span>, we simulate the scaled problem for a few <span class="math">\(\beta\)</span> values
and recover the physical solution <span class="math">\(u\)</span> by translating and stretching the <span class="math">\(u\)</span>
axis and stretching the <span class="math">\(t\)</span> axis.</p>
<p>The scaling breaks down if <span class="math">\(I=0\)</span>. In that case we may choose <span class="math">\(u_m=0\)</span>,
<span class="math">\(u_c=b/a\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(t_c=1/b\)</span>, resulting in a slightly different scaled problem:</p>
<div class="math">
\[\frac{d\bar u}{d\bar t} = 1 -\bar u,\quad \bar u(0)=0{\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>As with <span class="math">\(b=0\)</span>, the case <span class="math">\(I=0\)</span> has a scaled problem with no physical
parameters!</p>
<p>It is common to drop the bars after scaling and write the scaled
problem as <span class="math">\(u^{\prime}=-u\)</span>, <span class="math">\(u(0)=1-\beta\)</span>, or <span class="math">\(u^{\prime}=1-u\)</span>, <span class="math">\(u(0)=0\)</span>.
Any implementation of the problem <span class="math">\(u^{\prime}=-au+b\)</span>, <span class="math">\(u(0)=I\)</span>, can be
reused for the scaled problem by setting <span class="math">\(a=1\)</span>, <span class="math">\(b=0\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(I=1-\beta\)</span>
in the code, if <span class="math">\(I\neq 0\)</span>, or one sets
<span class="math">\(a=1\)</span>, <span class="math">\(b=1\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(I=0\)</span> when the physical <span class="math">\(I\)</span> is zero.
Falling bodies in fluids, as described in the section <a class="reference internal" href="#decay-app-drag"><em>Vertical motion of a body in a viscous fluid</em></a>,
involves <span class="math">\(u^{\prime}=-au+b\)</span> with seven physical parameters. All these vanish
in the scaled version of the problem if we start the motion from rest!</p>

<div class="section" id="evolution-of-a-population">
<span id="decay-app-pop"></span><h2>Evolution of a population<a class="headerlink" href="#evolution-of-a-population" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p id="index-0">Let <span class="math">\(N\)</span> be the number of individuals in a population occupying some
spatial domain.  Despite <span class="math">\(N\)</span> being an integer in this problem, we
shall compute with <span class="math">\(N\)</span> as a real number and view <span class="math">\(N(t)\)</span> as a
continuous function of time.  The basic model assumption is that in a
time interval <span class="math">\(\Delta t\)</span> the number of newcomers to the populations
(newborns) is proportional to <span class="math">\(N\)</span>, with proportionality constant <span class="math">\(\bar
b\)</span>. The amount of newcomers will increase the population and result in
to</p>
<div class="math">
\[N(t+\Delta t) = N(t) + \bar bN(t){\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>It is obvious that a long time interval <span class="math">\(\Delta t\)</span> will result in
more newcomers and hence a larger <span class="math">\(\bar b\)</span>. Therefore, we introduce
<span class="math">\(b=\bar b/\Delta t\)</span>: the number of newcomers per unit time and per
individual. We must then multiply <span class="math">\(b\)</span> by the length of the time
interval considered and by the population size to get the
total number of new individuals, <span class="math">\(b\Delta t N\)</span>.</p>
<p>If the number of removals from the population (deaths) is also
proportional to <span class="math">\(N\)</span>, with proportionality constant <span class="math">\(d\Delta t\)</span>,
the population evolves according to</p>
<div class="math">
\[N(t+\Delta t) = N(t) + b\Delta t N(t) - d\Delta t N(t){\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>Dividing by <span class="math">\(\Delta t\)</span> and letting <span class="math">\(\Delta t \rightarrow 0\)</span>,
we get the ODE</p>
<div class="math">
\[N^{\prime} = (b-d)N,\quad N(0)=N_0{\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>In a population where the death rate (<span class="math">\(d\)</span>) is larger than
then newborn rate (<span class="math">\(b\)</span>), <span class="math">\(a&gt;0\)</span>, and the population experiences
exponential decay rather than exponential growth.</p>
<p>In some populations there is an immigration of individuals into the
spatial domain. With <span class="math">\(I\)</span> individuals coming in per time unit,
the equation for the population change becomes</p>
<div class="math">
\[N(t+\Delta t) = N(t) + b\Delta t N(t) - d\Delta t N(t) + \Delta t I{\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>The corresponding ODE reads</p>
<div class="math">
\[N^{\prime} = (b-d)N + I,\quad N(0)=N_0
{\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>Some simplification arises if we introduce a fractional measure
of the population: <span class="math">\(u=N/N_0\)</span> and set <span class="math">\(r=b-d\)</span>. The ODE problem
now becomes</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-decay:app:pop:ueq">
<span id="eq-decay-app-pop-ueq"></span><span class="eqno">(1)</span>\[     u^{\prime} = ru + f,\quad u(0)=1,\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(f=I/N_0\)</span> measures the net immigration per time unit as
the fraction of the initial population. Very often, <span class="math">\(r\)</span> is approximately
constant, but <span class="math">\(f\)</span> is usually a function of time.</p>
<p id="index-1">The growth rate <span class="math">\(r\)</span> of a population decreases if the environment
has limited resources. Suppose the environment can sustain at
most <span class="math">\(N_{\max}\)</span> individuals. We may then assume that the growth rate
approaches zero as <span class="math">\(N\)</span> approaches <span class="math">\(N_{\max}\)</span>, i.e., as <span class="math">\(u\)</span> approaches
<span class="math">\(M=N_{\max}/N_0\)</span>. The simplest possible evolution of <span class="math">\(r\)</span> is then a
linear function: <span class="math">\(r(t)=r_0(1-u(t)/M)\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(r_0\)</span>
is the initial growth rate when the population is small relative to the
maximum size and there is enough resources. Using this <span class="math">\(r(t)\)</span> in
<a href="#equation-decay:app:pop:ueq">(1)</a> results in the <em>logistic model</em> for the
evolution of a population (assuming for the moment that <span class="math">\(f=0\)</span>):</p>

<p>Initially, <span class="math">\(u\)</span> will grow at rate <span class="math">\(r_0\)</span>, but the growth will decay
as <span class="math">\(u\)</span> approaches <span class="math">\(M\)</span>, and then there is no more change in <span class="math">\(u\)</span>, causing
<span class="math">\(u\rightarrow M\)</span> as <span class="math">\(t\rightarrow\infty\)</span>.
Note that the logistic equation <span class="math">\(u^{\prime}=r_0(1-u/M)u\)</span> is <em>nonlinear</em> because
of the quadratic term <span class="math">\(-u^2r_0/M\)</span>.</p>

<div class="section" id="compound-interest-and-inflation">
<span id="decay-app-interest"></span><h2>Compound interest and inflation<a class="headerlink" href="#compound-interest-and-inflation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Say the annual interest rate is <span class="math">\(r\)</span> percent and that the bank
adds the interest once a year to your investment.
If <span class="math">\(u^n\)</span> is the investment in year <span class="math">\(n\)</span>, the investment in year <span class="math">\(u^{n+1}\)</span>
grows to</p>
<div class="math">
\[u^{n+1} = u^n + \frac{r}{100}u^n

<p>In reality, the interest rate is added every day. We therefore introduce
a parameter <span class="math">\(m\)</span> for the number of periods per year when the interest
is added. If <span class="math">\(n\)</span> counts the periods, we have the fundamental model
for compound interest:</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-decay:app:interest:eq1">

     {\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>This model is a <em>difference equation</em>, but it can be transformed to a
continuous differential equation through a limit process.
The first step is to derive a formula for the growth of the investment
over a time <span class="math">\(t\)</span>.
Starting with an investment <span class="math">\(u^0\)</span>, and assuming that <span class="math">\(r\)</span> is constant in time,
we get</p>
<div class="math">
\[\begin{split}u^{n+1} &amp;= \left(1 + \frac{r}{100 m}\right)u^{n}\\
&amp;= \left(1 + \frac{r}{100 m}\right)^2u^{n-1}\\
&amp;\ \ \vdots\\
&amp;= \left(1 +\frac{r}{100 m}\right)^{n+1}u^{0}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>Introducing time <span class="math">\(t\)</span>, which here is a real-numbered counter for years,
we have that <span class="math">\(n=mt\)</span>, so we can write</p>
<div class="math">
\[u^{mt} = \left(1 + \frac{r}{100 m}\right)^{mt} u^0{\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>The second step is to assume <em>continuous compounding</em>, meaning that the
interest is added continuously. This implies <span class="math">\(m\rightarrow\infty\)</span>, and
in the limit one gets the formula</p>
<div class="math">
\[u(t) = u_0e^{rt/100},\]</div>
<p>which is nothing but the solution of the ODE problem</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-decay:app:interest:eq2">

     {\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>This is then taken as the ODE model for compound interest if <span class="math">\(r&gt;0\)</span>.
However, the reasoning applies equally well to inflation, which is
just the case <span class="math">\(r&lt;0\)</span>. One may also take the <span class="math">\(r\)</span> in <a href="#equation-decay:app:interest:eq2">(4)</a>
as the net growth of an investemt, where <span class="math">\(r\)</span> takes both compound interest
and inflation into account. Note that for real applications we must
use a time-dependent <span class="math">\(r\)</span> in <a href="#equation-decay:app:interest:eq2">(4)</a>.</p>

Actually, the process is stochastic when viewed for a single atom,

<p>We have originally <span class="math">\(N_0\)</span> atoms. Each atom may have decayed or
survived at a particular time <span class="math">\(t\)</span>. We want to count how many original
atoms that are left, i.e., how many atoms that have survived.
The survival of a single atom at time <span class="math">\(t\)</span> is a random event. Since there
are only two outcomes, survival or decay, we have a
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_trial">Bernoulli trial</a>.
Let <span class="math">\(p\)</span> be the
probability of survival (implying that the probability of decay
is <span class="math">\(1-p\)</span>). If each atom survives independently of
the others, and the probability of survival is the same for every
atom, we have <span class="math">\(N_0\)</span> statistically Bernoulli trials, known as
a <em>binomial experiment</em> from probability theory.
The probability <span class="math">\(P(N)\)</span> that <span class="math">\(N\)</span> out
of the <span class="math">\(N_0\)</span> atoms have survived at time <span class="math">\(t\)</span> is then given by the

<p>It remains to estimate <span class="math">\(p\)</span>. Let the interval <span class="math">\([0,t]\)</span> be divided into <span class="math">\(m\)</span>
small subintervals of length <span class="math">\(\Delta t\)</span>. We make the assumption that
the probability of decay of a single atom in an interval of length <span class="math">\(\Delta t\)</span>
is <span class="math">\(\tilde p\)</span>, and that this probability is proportional to <span class="math">\(\Delta t\)</span>:
<span class="math">\(\tilde p = \lambda\Delta t\)</span> (it sounds natural that the probability
of decay increases with <span class="math">\(\Delta t\)</span>). The corresponding probability of survival
is <span class="math">\(1-\lambda\Delta t\)</span>. Believing that <span class="math">\(\lambda\)</span> is independent
of time, we have, for each interval of length <span class="math">\(\Delta t\)</span>,
a Bernoulli trial: the atom either survives or
decays in that interval. Now, <span class="math">\(p\)</span> should be the probability that the atom
survives in all the intervals, i.e., that we have <span class="math">\(m\)</span> successful
Bernoulli trials in a row and therefore</p>
<div class="math">
\[p = (1-\lambda\Delta t)^m{\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>The expected number of atoms of the original type at time <span class="math">\(t\)</span> is</p>
<div class="math">
\[{\hbox{E}\lbrack P \rbrack} = N_0p = N_0(1-\lambda\Delta t)^m,\quad m=t/\Delta t{\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>To see the relation between the two types of Bernoulli trials and the
ODE above, we go to the limit <span class="math">\(\Delta t\rightarrow t\)</span>, <span class="math">\(m\rightarrow\infty\)</span>.
One can show that</p>
<div class="math">
\[p = \lim_{m\rightarrow\infty} (1-\lambda\Delta t)^m
= \lim_{m\rightarrow\infty} \left(1-\lambda\frac{t}{m}\right)^m = e^{-\lambda t}\]</div>
<p>This is the famous exponential waiting time (or arrival time) distribution for a
Poisson process in probability theory (obtained here, as often done, as
the limit of a binomial experiment). The probability of decay,
<span class="math">\(1-e^{-\lambda t}\)</span>, follows an <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_distribution">exponential distribution</a>.
The limit means that <span class="math">\(m\)</span> is very

of <span class="math">\(a\)</span> via <span class="math">\(\lambda\)</span> or vice versa. Our important finding here
is that the ODE model
captures the mean behavior of the underlying stochastic model. This
is, however, not always the common relation between microscopic stochastic
models and macroscopic &#8220;averaged&#8221; models.</p>
<p>Also of interest is to see that a Forward Euler discretization of
<span class="math">\(N^{\prime}=-\lambda N\)</span>, <span class="math">\(N(0)=N_0\)</span>, gives <span class="math">\(N^m = N_0(1-\lambda\Delta t)^m\)</span>

expected value of the stochastic experiment with <span class="math">\(N_0\)</span> atoms

decay with probability <span class="math">\(\lambda\Delta t\)</span> in an interval.</p>
<p>A fundamental question is how accurate the ODE model is. The underlying
stochastic model fluctuates around its expected value. A measure
of the fluctuations is the standard deviation of the binomial experiment with
<span class="math">\(N_0\)</span> atoms, which can be shown to be <span class="math">\({\hbox{Std}\lbrack P \rbrack}=\sqrt{N_0p(1-p)}\)</span>. Compared
to the size of the expectation, we get
the normalized standard deviation</p>
<div class="math">
\[\frac{\sqrt{{\hbox{Var}\lbrack P \rbrack}}}{{\hbox{E}\lbrack P \rbrack}} = N_0^{-1/2}\sqrt{p^{-1}-1}

<span id="decay-app-newton-cooling"></span><h2>Newton&#8217;s law of cooling<a class="headerlink" href="#newton-s-law-of-cooling" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When a body at some temperature is placed in a cooling environment,
experience shows that the temperature falls rapidly in the beginning,
and then the changes in temperature levels off until the body&#8217;s
temperature equals that of the surroundings. Newton carried out some
experiments on cooling hot iron and found that the temperature
evolved as a &#8220;geometric progression at times in arithmetic progression&#8221;,
meaning that the temperature decayed exponentially.
Later, this result was formulated as a differential equation:
the rate of change of the temperature in a body is proportional to
the temperature difference between the body and its surroundings.
This statement is known as <em>Newton&#8217;s law of cooling</em>, which
can be mathematically expressed as</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-decay:Newton:cooling">
<span id="id1"></span><span class="eqno">(5)</span>\[     {dT\over dt} = -k(T-T_s),\]</div>

from the surface of the body by a flowing fluid such as air
at constant temperature <span class="math">\(T_s\)</span>.
The <em>heat transfer coefficient</em> <span class="math">\(k\)</span> reflects the transfer of
heat from the body to
the surroundings and must be determined from physical experiments.</p>

<p>Suitable values of <span class="math">\(\mu\)</span> are <span class="math">\(1.8\cdot 10^{-5}\hbox{ Pa}\, \hbox{s}\)</span> for air
and <span class="math">\(8.9\cdot 10^{-4}\hbox{ Pa}\, \hbox{s}\)</span> for water.
Densities can be taken as <span class="math">\(1.2\hbox{ kg/m}^3\)</span> for air and as
<span class="math">\(1.0\cdot 10^3\hbox{ kg/m}^3\)</span> for water. For considerable vertical
displacement in the atmosphere one should take into account that
the density of air varies with the altitude, see the section <a class="reference internal" href="#decay-app-atm"><em>Decay of atmospheric pressure with altitude</em></a>.
One possible density variation arises from the one-layer model
in the mentioned section.</p>
<p>Any density variation makes <span class="math">\(b\)</span> time dependent and we need
<span class="math">\(b^{n+\frac{1}{2}}\)</span> in <a href="#equation-decay:app:fallingbody:gmodel:q:CN">(15)</a>.
To compute the density that enters
<span class="math">\(b^{n+\frac{1}{2}}\)</span> we must also compute the vertical
position <span class="math">\(z(t)\)</span> of the body. Since <span class="math">\(v=dz/dt\)</span>, we can use a centered
difference approximation:</p>
<div class="math">
\[\frac{z^{n+\frac{1}{2}} - z^{n-\frac{1}{2}}}{\Delta t} = v^n
\quad\Rightarrow\quad z^{n+\frac{1}{2}} = z^{n-\frac{1}{2}}+\Delta t\, v^n{\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>This <span class="math">\(z^{n+\frac{1}{2}}\)</span> is used in the expression for <span class="math">\(b\)</span>
to compute <span class="math">\(\varrho(z^{n+\frac{1}{2}})\)</span> and then <span class="math">\(b^{n+\frac{1}{2}}\)</span>.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_coefficient">drag coefficient</a> <span class="math">\(C_D\)</span> depends heavily
on the shape of the body.  Some values are: 0.45 for a sphere, 0.42
for a semi-sphere, 1.05 for a cube, 0.82 for a long cylinder (when the
center axis is in the vertical direction), 0.75 for a rocket,
1.0-1.3 for a man in upright position, 1.3 for a flat plate perpendicular
to the flow, and
0.04 for a streamlined, droplet-like body.</p>

<div class="section" id="verification">
<h3>Verification<a class="headerlink" href="#verification" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>To verify the program, one may assume a heavy body in air such that the <span class="math">\(F_b\)</span>
force can be neglected, and further assume a small velocity such that the
air resistance <span class="math">\(F_d\)</span> can also be neglected. This can be obtained by
setting <span class="math">\(\mu\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\varrho\)</span> to zero. The motion then leads to
the velocity
<span class="math">\(v(t)=v_0 - gt\)</span>, which is linear in <span class="math">\(t\)</span> and therefore should be
reproduced to machine precision (say tolerance <span class="math">\(10^{-15}\)</span>) by any
implementation based on the Crank-Nicolson or Forward Euler schemes.</p>
<p>Another verification, but not as powerful as the one above,
can be based on computing the terminal velocity and comparing with
the exact expressions.
The advantage of this verification is that we can also
the test situation <span class="math">\(\varrho\neq 0\)</span>.</p>
<p>As always, the method of manufactured solutions can be applied to
test the implementation of all terms in the governing equation, but
the solution then has no physical relevance in general.</p>

<div class="section" id="scaling-2">
<span id="index-6"></span><h3>Scaling  (2)<a class="headerlink" href="#scaling-2" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Applying scaling, as described in the section <a class="reference internal" href="#decay-app-scaling"><em>Scaling  (1)</em></a>,
will for the linear case reduce the need to estimate values for
seven parameters down to choosing one value of a single dimensionless parameter</p>
<div class="math">
\[\beta = \frac{\varrho_b gV\left(\frac{\varrho}{\varrho_b} -1\right)}{3\pi d\mu I},\]</div>
<p>provided <span class="math">\(I\neq 0\)</span>. If the motion starts from rest, <span class="math">\(I=0\)</span>, the scaled
problem <span class="math">\(\bar u^{\prime}=1-\bar u\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\bar u(0)=0\)</span>, has no need for
estimating physical parameters.
This means that there is a single universal solution to the problem
of a falling body starting from rest:
<span class="math">\(\bar u(t) = 1 - e^{-\bar t}\)</span>. All real
physical cases correspond to stretching the <span class="math">\(\bar t\)</span> axis and the <span class="math">\(\bar u\)</span>
axis in this dimensionless solution. More precisely, the physical velocity
<span class="math">\(u(t)\)</span> is related to the dimensionless velocity <span class="math">\(\bar u(\bar t)\)</span> through</p>

<p>Suppose we have a partial differential equation</p>
<div class="math">
\[\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \alpha\frac{\partial^2u}{\partial x^2}

<p>with boundary conditions <span class="math">\(u(0,t)=u(L,t)=0\)</span> and initial condition
<span class="math">\(u(x,0)=I(x)\)</span>. One may express the solution as</p>
<div class="math">
\[u(x,t) = \sum_{k=1}^m A_k(t)e^{ikx\pi/L},\]</div>
<p>for appropriate unknown functions <span class="math">\(A_k\)</span>, <span class="math">\(k=1,\ldots,m\)</span>.
We use the complex exponential <span class="math">\(e^{ikx\pi/L}\)</span> for easy algebra, but
the physical <span class="math">\(u\)</span> is taken as the real part of any complex expression.
Note that the expansion in terms of <span class="math">\(e^{ikx\pi/L}\)</span> is compatible with
the boundary conditions: all functions <span class="math">\(e^{ikx\pi/L}\)</span> vanish for
<span class="math">\(x=0\)</span> and <span class="math">\(x=L\)</span>. Suppose we can express <span class="math">\(I(x)\)</span> as</p>
<div class="math">
\[I(x) = \sum_{k=1}^m I_ke^{ikx\pi/L}
{\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>Such an expansion can be computed by well-known Fourier expansion techniques,
but the details are not important here.
Also, suppose we can express the given <span class="math">\(f(x,t)\)</span> as</p>
<div class="math">
\[f(x,t) = \sum_{k=1}^m b_k(t)e^{ikx\pi/L}
{\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>Inserting the expansions for <span class="math">\(u\)</span>
and <span class="math">\(f\)</span> in the differential equations demands that all terms corresponding
to a given <span class="math">\(k\)</span> must be equal. The calculations results in the follow
system of ODEs:</p>
<div class="math">
\[A_k^{\prime}(t) = -\alpha\frac{k^2\pi^2}{L^2} + b_k(t),\quad k=1,\ldots,m
{\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>From the initial condition</p>
<div class="math">
\[u(x,0)=\sum_k A_k(0)e^{ikx\pi/L}=I(x)=\sum_k I_k e^{(ikx\pi/L)},\]</div>
<p>it follows that <span class="math">\(A_k(0)=I_k\)</span>, <span class="math">\(k=1,\ldots,m\)</span>. We then have <span class="math">\(m\)</span>
equations of the form <span class="math">\(A_k^{\prime}=-a A_k +b\)</span>, <span class="math">\(A_k(0)=I_k\)</span>, for
appropriate definitions of <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span>. These ODE problems
independent each other such that we can solve one problem
at a time. The outline technique is a quite common approach for solving
partial differential equations.</p>
<p><strong>Remark.</strong>
Since <span class="math">\(a_k\)</span> depends on <span class="math">\(k\)</span> and the stability of
the Forward Euler scheme demands <span class="math">\(a_k\Delta t \leq 1\)</span>, we get that
<span class="math">\(\Delta t \leq \alpha^{-1}L^2\pi^{-2} k^{-2}\)</span>. Usually, quite large
<span class="math">\(k\)</span> values are needed to accurately represent the given functions
<span class="math">\(I\)</span> and <span class="math">\(f\)</span> and then <span class="math">\(\Delta t\)</span> needs to be very small for these large
values of <span class="math">\(k\)</span>.
Therefore, the Crank-Nicolson and Backward Euler schemes, which
allow larger <span class="math">\(\Delta t\)</span> without any growth in the solutions, are
more popular choices when creating time-stepping algorithms for
partial differential equations of the type considered in this
example.</p>

several approaches for verifying the implementation.</p>
<p><strong>a)</strong>
Implement the <span class="math">\(\theta\)</span>-rule from

<div class="highlight-text"><div class="highlight"><pre>cooling(T0, k, T_s, t_end, dt, theta=0.5)
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>where <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">T0</span></tt> is the initial temperature, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">k</span></tt> is
the heat transfer coefficient, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">T_s</span></tt> is a function of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">t</span></tt> for

time step, and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">theta</span></tt> corresponds to <span class="math">\(\theta\)</span>.  The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cooling</span></tt>
function should return the temperature as an array <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">T</span></tt> of values at
the mesh points and the time mesh <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">t</span></tt>.</p>
<p><strong>b)</strong>
In the case <span class="math">\(\lim_{t\rightarrow\infty}T_s(t)=C=\mbox{const}\)</span>,
explain why <span class="math">\(T(t)\rightarrow C\)</span>. Construct an example where you
can illustrate this property in a plot. Implement a corresponding
test function that checks the correctness of the asymptotic
value of the solution.</p>
<p><strong>c)</strong>
A piecewise constant surrounding temperature,</p>
<div class="math">
\[\begin{split}T_s(t) = \left\lbrace\begin{array}{ll} C_0,&amp; 0\leq t\leq t^*\\

<span class="math">\(t^*=4/k\)</span>. Plot the solution and explain why it seems physically
reasonable.</p>
<p><strong>d)</strong>
Find a value of <span class="math">\(\Delta t\)</span> such that you can illustrate stability
problems of the Crank-Nicolson scheme in the test case from c).</p>
<p><strong>e)</strong>
Find an expression for the exact solution of
<a href="#equation-decay:Newton:cooling">(16)</a>.  Construct a test case and compare the
numerical and exact solution in a plot. Find a value of the time step
<span class="math">\(\Delta t\)</span> such that the two solution curves cannot (visually) be
distinguished from each other. Many scientists will claim that such a
plot provides evidence for a correct implementation, but point out why
there still may be errors in the code.  Can you introduce bugs in the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cooling</span></tt> function and still achieve visually coinciding curves?</p>
<p><strong>Hint.</strong>
The exact solution can be derived by multiplying <a href="#equation-decay:Newton:cooling">(16)</a>
by the integrating factor <span class="math">\(e^{kt}\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>f)</strong>
Implement a test function for checking that the solution returned by
the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">cooling</span></tt> function is identical to the exact numerical
solution of the problem (to machine precision) when <span class="math">\(T_s\)</span> is constant.</p>
<p><strong>Hint.</strong>
The exact solution of the
discrete equations in the case <span class="math">\(T_s\)</span> is a constant can be found by
introducing <span class="math">\(u=T-T_s\)</span> to get a problem <span class="math">\(u^{\prime}=-ku\)</span>, <span class="math">\(u(0)=T_0-T_s\)</span>.
The solution of the discrete equations is then of the form
<span class="math">\(u^{n}=(T_0-T_s)A^n\)</span> for some amplification factor <span class="math">\(A\)</span>. This
approach can be used to derive an expression for <span class="math">\(T^n\)</span>.</p>

<span id="decay-app-exer-parachute"></span><h2>Project 24: Simulate parachuting<a class="headerlink" href="#project-24-simulate-parachuting" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The aim of this project is to develop a general solver for the
vertical motion of a body with quadratic air drag, verify the solver,
apply the solver to a skydiver in free fall, and finally apply the
solver to a complete parachute jump.</p>
<p>All the pieces of software implemented in this project
should be realized as Python functions and/or classes and collected
in one module.</p>
<p><strong>a)</strong>
Set up the differential equation problem that governs the velocity
of the motion.
The parachute jumper is subject to the gravity force and a quadratic
drag force. Assume constant density.
Add an extra source term be used for program verification.
Identify the input data to the problem.</p>
<p><strong>b)</strong>
Make a Python module for computing the velocity of the motion.
Also equip the module with functionality for plotting the velocity.</p>
<p><strong>Hint 1.</strong>
Use the Crank-Nicolson scheme with a geometric mean of <span class="math">\(|v|v\)</span> in time to
linearize the equation of motion with quadratic drag.</p>
<p><strong>Hint 2.</strong>
You can either use functions or classes for implementation.
If you choose functions, make a function
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">solver</span></tt> that takes all the input data in the problem as
arguments and that returns the velocity (as a mesh function) and
the time mesh. In case of a class-based implementation, introduce
a problem class with the physical data
and a solver class with the numerical data and a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">solve</span></tt> method
that stores the velocity and the mesh in the class.</p>
<p>Allow for a time-dependent area and drag coefficient in the
formula for the drag force.</p>
<p><strong>c)</strong>
Show that a linear function of <span class="math">\(t\)</span> does not fulfill the discrete
equations because of the geometric mean approximation
used for the quadratic drag
term.  Fit a source term, as in the method of manufactured solutions,
such that a linear function of <span class="math">\(t\)</span> is a solution of the discrete
equations. Make a test function to check that this solution is reproduced
to machine precision.</p>
<p><strong>d)</strong>
The expected error in this problem goes like <span class="math">\(\Delta t^2\)</span> because we
use a centered finite difference approximation with error <span class="math">\({\mathcal{O}(\Delta t^2)}\)</span>
and a geometric mean approximation with error <span class="math">\({\mathcal{O}(\Delta t^2)}\)</span>.
Use the method of manufactured solutions combined with computing
convergence rate to verify the code. Make a test function for checking
that the convergence rate is correct.</p>
<p><strong>e)</strong>
Compute the drag force, the gravity
force, and the buoyancy force as a function of time. Create
a plot with these three forces.</p>
<p><strong>Hint.</strong>
You can either make a function <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">forces(v,</span> <span class="pre">t,</span> <span class="pre">plot=None)</span></tt>
that returns the forces (as mesh functions) and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">t</span></tt>, and shows
a plot on the screen and also saves the plot to a file with name
stored in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">plot</span></tt>
if <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">plot</span></tt> is not <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">None</span></tt>, or you can extend the solver class with
computation of forces and include plotting of forces in the
visualization class.</p>
<p><strong>f)</strong>
Compute the velocity of
a skydiver in free fall before the parachute opens.</p>
<p><strong>Hint.</strong>
Meade and Struthers <a class="reference internal" href="._main_decay008.html#ref7" id="id4">[Ref7]</a> provide some data relevant
to <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parachuting">skydiving</a>.
The mass of the human body and equipment
can be set to <span class="math">\(100\)</span> kg.
A skydiver in spread-eagle formation has a cross-section of 0.5 <span class="math">\(\hbox{m}^2\)</span>
in the horizontal plane.
The density of air decreases varies altitude, but can be taken
as constant, 1 <span class="math">\(\hbox{kg/m}^3\)</span>, for altitudes relevant to
skydiving (0-4000 m).
The drag coefficient for a man in upright position can be set to 1.2.
Start with a zero velocity.
A free fall typically has a terminating velocity of 45 m/s. (This value
can be used to tune other parameters.)</p>
<p><strong>g)</strong>
The next task is to simulate
a parachute jumper during free fall and after the parachute opens.
At time <span class="math">\(t_p\)</span>, the parachute opens and
the drag coefficient and the cross-sectional
area change dramatically.
Use the program to simulate a jump from <span class="math">\(z=3000\)</span> m to the ground <span class="math">\(z=0\)</span>.
What is the maximum acceleration, measured in units of <span class="math">\(g\)</span>,
experienced by the jumper?</p>
<p><strong>Hint.</strong>
Following Meade and Struthers <a class="reference internal" href="._main_decay008.html#ref7" id="id5">[Ref7]</a>, one can set the
cross-section area perpendicular to the motion to 44 <span class="math">\(\hbox{m}^2\)</span>
when the parachute is open. Assume that it takes 8 s to increase
the area linearly from the original to the final value.
The drag coefficient for an open
parachute can be taken as 1.8, but tuned using the known value
of the typical terminating velocity reached before landing:
5.3 m/s. One can take the drag coefficient as a piecewise constant
function with an abrupt change at <span class="math">\(t_p\)</span>.
The parachute is typically released after <span class="math">\(t_p=60\)</span> s, but
larger values of <span class="math">\(t_p\)</span> can be used to make plots more illustrative.</p>

The equation of motion for the body is given in

<p>The goal of this exercise is to compute the value of a fortune subject
to inflation and a random interest rate.
Suppose that the inflation is constant at <span class="math">\(i\)</span> percent per year and that the
annual interest rate, <span class="math">\(p\)</span>, changes randomly at each time step,
starting at some value <span class="math">\(p_0\)</span> at <span class="math">\(t=0\)</span>.
The random change is from a value <span class="math">\(p^n\)</span> at <span class="math">\(t=t_n\)</span> to

No change occurs with probability 0.5. There is also no change if
<span class="math">\(p^{n+1}\)</span> exceeds 15 or becomes below 1.
Use a time step of one month, <span class="math">\(p_0=i\)</span>, initial fortune scaled to 1,
