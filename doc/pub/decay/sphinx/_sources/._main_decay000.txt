Introduction to computing with finite difference methods

Finite difference methods for partial differential equations (PDEs)
employ a range of concepts and tools that can be introduced and
illustrated in the context of simple ordinary differential equation
(ODE) examples.  This is what we do in the present document.  By
first working with ODEs, we keep the mathematical problems to be
solved as simple as possible (but no simpler), thereby allowing full
focus on understanding the key concepts and tools.  The choice of
topics in the forthcoming treatment of ODEs is therefore solely
dominated by what carries over to numerical methods for PDEs.

Theory and practice are primarily illustrated by solving the
very simple ODE :math:`u'=-au`, :math:`u(0)=I`, where :math:`a>0` is a constant,
but we also address the generalized problem :math:`u'=-a(t)u + b(t)`
and the nonlinear problem :math:`u'=f(u,t)`.
The following topics are introduced:

 * How to think when constructing finite difference methods, with special focus
   on the Forward Euler, Backward Euler, and Crank-Nicolson (midpoint)
   schemes

 * How to formulate a computational algorithm and translate it into
   Python code

 * How to make curve plots of the solutions

 * How to compute numerical errors

 * How to compute convergence rates

 * How to verify an implementation and automate verification
   through nose tests in Python

 * How to structure code in terms of functions, classes, and modules

 * How to work with Python concepts such as arrays, lists, dictionaries,
   lambda functions, functions in functions (closures), doctests,
   unit tests, command-line interfaces, graphical user interfaces

 * How to perform array computing and understand the difference from
   scalar computing

 * How to conduct and automate large-scale numerical experiments

 * How to generate scientific reports

 * How to uncover numerical artifacts in the computed solution

 * How to analyze the numerical schemes mathematically to understand
   why artifacts occur

 * How to derive mathematical expressions for various measures of
   the error in numerical methods, frequently by using the ``sympy`` software
   for symbolic computation

 * Introduce concepts such as finite difference operators,
   mesh (grid), mesh functions,
   stability, truncation error, consistency, and convergence

 * Present additional methods for the general nonlinear ODE :math:`u'=f(u,t)`,
   which is either a scalar ODE or a system of ODEs

 * How to access professional packages for solving ODEs

 * How the model equation :math:`u'=-au` arises in a wide range
   of phenomena in physics, biology, and finance


.. admonition:: The exposition in a nutshell

   Everything we cover is put into a practical, hands-on context. All
   mathematics is translated into working computing codes, and all the
   mathematical theory of finite difference methods presented here is
   motivated from a strong need to understand strange behavior of programs.
   Two fundamental questions saturate the text:
   
    * How to we solve a differential equation problem and produce numbers?
   
    * How to we trust the answer?
