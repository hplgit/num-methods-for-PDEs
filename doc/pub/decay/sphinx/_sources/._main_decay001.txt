Finite difference methods
=========================


.. admonition:: Contents of this document

   We explain the basic ideas of finite difference methods
   primarily via the simple ordinary differential equation :math:`u^{\prime}=-au`.
   Emphasis is put on the reasoning behind problem discretizing and
   introduction of key concepts such as mesh, mesh function,
   finite difference approximations, averaging in a mesh,
   derivation of algorithms, and discrete operator notation.




.. _decay:model:

A basic model for exponential decay
-----------------------------------

.. index:: decay ODE

.. index:: exponential decay

Our model problem is perhaps the simplest ordinary differential
equation (ODE):

.. math::
        
        u^{\prime}(t) = -au(t){\thinspace .}
        

Here, :math:`u(t)` is a scalar function of time :math:`t`,
:math:`a` is a constant, and :math:`u^{\prime}(t)` means differentiation with
respect to :math:`t`. This type of equation arises in a number of
widely different phenomena where some quantity :math:`u` undergoes
exponential reduction. Examples include radioactive decay, population
decay, investment decay, cooling of an object, pressure decay in the
atmosphere, and retarded motion in fluids (for some of these models,
:math:`a` can be negative as well), see the section :ref:`decay:app` for details
and motivation.  We have chosen this particular ODE not only because
its applications are relevant, but even more because studying
numerical solution methods for this particular ODE gives important insight
that can be reused in far more complicated settings, in particular
when solving diffusion-type partial differential equations.

The exact solution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Although our interest is in *approximate* numerical solutions of :math:`u^{\prime}=-au`, it is convenient to know the exact analytical solution of the problem so
we can compute the error in numerical approximation.
The analytical solution of this ODE is found by
separation of variables, which results in

.. math::
         u(t) = Ce^{-at},

for any arbitrary constant :math:`C`.
To obtain a unique solution, we need a condition to fix the value of :math:`C`.
This condition is known as the *initial condition* and stated as
:math:`u(0)=I`. That is, we know that the value of :math:`u` is :math:`I` when the process
starts at :math:`t=0`. With this knowledge, the exact solution becomes
:math:`u(t)=Ie^{-at}`. The initial condition is also crucial for numerical
methods: without it, we can never start the numerical algorithms!

Complete problem formulation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ODE needs an initial condition, and we must also specify a
time interval for the solution: :math:`t\in (0,T]`.
The point :math:`t=0` is not
included since we know that :math:`u(0)=I` and assume that the equation governs
:math:`u` for :math:`t>0`.
Let us now summarize the information that is required to
state the complete problem formulation:
find :math:`u(t)`
such that

.. _Eq:decay:problem:

.. math::
   :label: decay:problem
        
        u^{\prime} = -au,\ t\in (0,T], \quad u(0)=I{\thinspace .}   
        

This is known as a *continuous problem* because the parameter :math:`t`
varies continuously from :math:`0` to :math:`T`. For each :math:`t` we have a corresponding
:math:`u(t)`. There are hence infinitely many values of :math:`t` and :math:`u(t)`.
The purpose of a numerical method is to formulate a corresponding
*discrete* problem whose solution is characterized by a finite number of values,
which can be computed in a finite number of steps on a computer.
Typically, we choose a finite set of time values :math:`t_0,t_1,\ldots,t_{N_t}`,
and create algorithms that generate the corresponding :math:`u` values
:math:`u_0,u_1,\ldots,u_{N_t}`.

.. _decay:schemes:FE:

The Forward Euler scheme
------------------------

Solving an ODE like :eq:`decay:problem` by a finite difference method
consists of the following four steps:

1. discretizing the domain,

2. requiring fulfillment of the equation at discrete time points,

3. replacing derivatives by finite differences,

4. formulating a recursive algorithm.

.. index:: mesh

.. index:: grid

Step 1: Discretizing the domain
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The time domain :math:`[0,T]` is represented by a finite number of
:math:`N_t+1` points

.. math::
        
        0 = t_0 < t_1 < t_2 < \cdots < t_{N_t-1} < t_{N_t} = T{\thinspace .}
        

The collection of points :math:`t_0,t_1,\ldots,t_{N_t}` constitutes a *mesh*
or *grid*. Often the mesh points will be uniformly spaced in
the domain :math:`[0,T]`, which means that the spacing :math:`t_{n+1}-t_n` is
the same for all :math:`n`. This spacing is often denoted by :math:`\Delta t`,
which means that :math:`t_n=n\Delta t`.

.. index:: mesh function

We want the solution :math:`u` at the mesh points:
:math:`u(t_n)`, :math:`n=0,1,\ldots,N_t`.
A notational short-form for :math:`u(t_n)`,
which will be used extensively, is :math:`u^{n}`. More precisely, we let
:math:`u^n` be the *numerical approximation* to the exact solution :math:`u(t_n)`
at :math:`t=t_n`.

When we need to clearly distinguish between the numerical and exact solution,
we often place a subscript e on the exact solution, as in :math:`{u_{\small\mbox{e}}}(t_n)`.
Figure :ref:`decay:fdu:e` shows the :math:`t_n` and :math:`u^n` points for :math:`n=0,1,\ldots,N_t=7` as well as :math:`{u_{\small\mbox{e}}}(t)` as the dashed line.

.. _decay:fdu:e:

.. figure:: fdm_u_ue.png
   :width: 600

   *Time mesh with discrete solution values at points and a dashed line indicating the true solution*

We say that the numerical approximation, i.e.,
the collection of :math:`u^n` values for :math:`n=0,\ldots,N_t`,
constitutes a *mesh function*.
A "normal" continuous function is a curve defined for all real :math:`t`
values in :math:`[0,T]`, but a mesh function is only defined at discrete
points in time. If you want to compute the mesh function *between* the
mesh points, where it is not defined, an *interpolation method* must be
used. Usually, linear interpolation, i.e., drawing a straight line between
the mesh function values, see Figure :ref:`decay:fdu:e`, suffices.
To compute the solution for some :math:`t\in [t_n, t_{n+1}]`, we use the
linear interpolation formula

.. math::
        
        u(t) \approx u^n + \frac{u^{n+1}-u^n}{t_{n+1}-t_n}(t - t_n){\thinspace .}
        

.. _decay:fdu:ei:

.. figure:: fdm_u_uei.png
   :width: 600

   *Linear interpolation between the discrete solution values (dashed curve is exact solution)*


.. note::
   The goal of a numerical solution method for ODEs is
   to compute the mesh function by solving a finite set of
   *algebraic equations* derived from the original ODE problem.




Step 2: Fulfilling the equation at discrete time points
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ODE is supposed to hold for all :math:`t\in (0,T]`, i.e., at an infinite
number of points. Now we relax that requirement and require that
the ODE is fulfilled at a finite set of discrete points in time.
The mesh points :math:`t_0,t_1,\ldots,t_{N_t}` are a natural
(but not the only) choice of points.
The original ODE is then reduced to  the following equations:

.. _Eq:decay:step2:

.. math::
   :label: decay:step2
        
        u^{\prime}(t_n) = -au(t_n),\quad n=0,\ldots,N_t,\quad u(0)=I{\thinspace .}
        
        

Even though the original ODE is not stated to be valid at :math:`t=0`, it
is valid as close to :math:`t=0` as we like, and it turns out that it
is useful for construction of numerical methods to have
:eq:`decay:step2` valid for :math:`n=0`. The next two steps show that we
need :eq:`decay:step2` for :math:`n=0`.

.. index:: finite differences

Step 3: Replacing derivatives by finite differences
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The next and most essential step of the method is to replace the
derivative :math:`u^{\prime}` by a finite difference approximation. Let us first
try a *forward* difference approximation (see Figure :ref:`decay:sketch:FE`),

.. index:: forward difference

.. index::
   single: finite differences; forward

.. _Eq:decay:FEdiff:

.. math::
   :label: decay:FEdiff
        
        u^{\prime}(t_n) \approx \frac{u^{n+1}-u^{n}}{t_{n+1}-t_n}{\thinspace .}
        
        

The name forward relates to the fact that we use a value forward in
time, :math:`u^{n+1}`, together with the value :math:`u^n` at the point :math:`t_n`, where
we seek the derivative, to approximate :math:`u^{\prime}(t_n)`.
Inserting this approximation in :eq:`decay:step2` results in

.. _Eq:decay:step3:

.. math::
   :label: decay:step3
        
        \frac{u^{n+1}-u^{n}}{t_{n+1}-t_n} = -au^{n},\quad n=0,1,\ldots,N_t-1{\thinspace .}
        
        

Note that if we want to compute the solution
up to time level :math:`N_t`,
we only need :eq:`decay:step2` to hold for :math:`n=0,\ldots,N_t-1` since
:eq:`decay:step3` for :math:`n=N_t-1` creates an equation for the final
value :math:`u^{N_t}`.

Also note that we use the approximation symbol :math:`\approx` in :eq:`decay:FEdiff`,
but not in :eq:`decay:step3`. Instead, we view :eq:`decay:step3` as
an equation that is not mathematically equivalent to :eq:`decay:FEdiff`,
but represents an approximation to the equation :eq:`decay:FEdiff`.

Equation :eq:`decay:step3`
is the discrete counterpart to the original ODE problem
:eq:`decay:problem`, and often referred to as a *finite difference scheme*
or more generally as the *discrete equations* of the problem.
The fundamental feature of these equations is that they are *algebraic*
and can hence be straightforwardly solved to produce the mesh function, i.e.,
the approximate values of :math:`u` at
the mesh points: :math:`u^n`, :math:`n=1,2,\ldots,N_t`.

   :width: 400

   *Illustration of a forward difference*

.. index:: difference equation

.. index:: discrete equation

.. index:: algebraic equation

.. index:: finite difference scheme

.. index:: Forward Euler scheme

Step 4: Formulating a recursive algorithm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The final step is to identify the computational algorithm to be implemented
in a program. The key observation here is to realize that
:eq:`decay:step3` can be used to compute :math:`u^{n+1}` if :math:`u^n` is known.
Starting with :math:`n=0`, :math:`u^0` is known since :math:`u^0=u(0)=I`, and
:eq:`decay:step3` gives an equation for :math:`u^1`. Knowing :math:`u^1`,
:math:`u^2` can be found from :eq:`decay:step3`. In general, :math:`u^n`
in :eq:`decay:step3` can be assumed known, and then we can easily solve for
the unknown :math:`u^{n+1}`:

.. _Eq:decay:FE:

.. math::
   :label: decay:FE
        
        u^{n+1} = u^n - a(t_{n+1} -t_n)u^n{\thinspace .}
        
        

We shall refer to :eq:`decay:FE` as the Forward Euler (FE) scheme
for our model problem. From a mathematical point of view,
equations of the form :eq:`decay:FE` are known as
*difference equations* since they express how differences in
the dependent variable, here :math:`u`, evolve with :math:`n`. In our case,
the differences in :math:`u` are given by :math:`u^{n+1}-u^n = -a(t_{n+1}-t_n)u^n`.
The finite difference method can be viewed as a method for turning
a differential equation into an algebraic difference equation that
can be easily solved by repeated use of a formula like :eq:`decay:FE`.

Interpretation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is a very intuitive interpretation of the FE scheme, illustrated
in the sketch below. We have computed some point values
on the solution curve (small red disks), and the question is how we reason
about the next point. Since we know :math:`u` and :math:`t` at the most recently
computed point, the differential equation gives us the *slope* of
the solution curve: :math:`u'=-au`. We can draw this slope as a red line
and continue the solution curve along that slope. As soon as we have
chosen the next point on this line, we have a new :math:`t` and :math:`u` value and
compute a new slope and continue the process.

Computing with the recursive formula
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mathematical computation with :eq:`decay:FE` is straightforward:

.. math::
        
        u_0 &= I,\\ 
        u_1 & = u^0 - a(t_{1} -t_0)u^0 = I(1-a(t_1-t_0)),\\ 
        u_2 & = u^1 - a(t_{2} -t_1)u^1 = I(1-a(t_1-t_0))(1 - a(t_2-t_1)),\\ 
        u^3 &= u^2 - a(t_{3} -t_2)u^2 = I(1-a(t_1-t_0))(1 - a(t_2-t_1))(1 - a(t_3-t_2)),
        

and so on until we reach :math:`u^{N_t}`.
Very often, :math:`t_{n+1}-t_n` is constant for all :math:`n`, so we can introduce
the common symbol
:math:`\Delta t = t_{n+1}-t_n`, :math:`n=0,1,\ldots,N_t-1`.
Using a constant mesh spacing :math:`\Delta t` in the above calculations gives

.. math::
        
        u_0 &= I,\\ 
        u_1 & = I(1-a\Delta t),\\ 
        u_2 & = I(1-a\Delta t)^2,\\ 
        u^3 &= I(1-a\Delta t)^3,\\ 
        &\vdots\\ 
        u^{N_t} &= I(1-a\Delta t)^{N_t}{\thinspace .}
        

This means that we have found a closed formula for :math:`u^n`, and there is
no need to let a computer generate the sequence :math:`u^1, u^2, u^3, \ldots`.
However, finding such a formula for :math:`u^n` is possible only for a few very
simple problems, so in general finite difference equations must be
solved on a computer.

As the next sections will show, the scheme :eq:`decay:FE` is just one
out of many alternative finite difference (and other) methods for
the model problem :eq:`decay:problem`.

.. _decay:schemes:BE:

The Backward Euler scheme
-------------------------

.. index:: backward difference

.. index::
   single: finite differences; backward

There are several choices of difference approximations in step 3 of
the finite difference method as presented in the previous section.
Another alternative is

.. _Eq:decay:BEdiff:

.. math::
   :label: decay:BEdiff
        
        u^{\prime}(t_n) \approx \frac{u^{n}-u^{n-1}}{t_{n}-t_{n-1}}{\thinspace .}
        
        

Since this difference is based on going backward in time (:math:`t_{n-1}`)
for information, it is known as a *backward* difference, also called
Backward Euler difference.
Figure :ref:`decay:sketch:BE` explains the idea.

.. _decay:sketch:BE:

.. figure:: fd_backward.png
   :width: 400

   *Illustration of a backward difference*

.. index::
   single: backward scheme, 1-step

.. index:: Backward Euler scheme

Inserting :eq:`decay:BEdiff` in :eq:`decay:step2` yields
the Backward Euler (BE) scheme:

.. _Eq:decay:BE0:

.. math::
   :label: decay:BE0
        
        \frac{u^{n}-u^{n-1}}{t_{n}-t_{n-1}} = -a u^n,\quad n=1,\ldots,N_t{\thinspace .}
        
        

We assume, as explained under step 4 in the section :ref:`decay:schemes:FE`,
that we have computed :math:`u^0, u^1, \ldots, u^{n-1}` such that
:eq:`decay:BE0` can be used to compute :math:`u^n`. Note that
:eq:`decay:BE0` needs :math:`n` to start at 1 (then it involves :math:`u^0`, but
no :math:`u^{-1}`) and end at :math:`N_t`.

For direct similarity with the formula for the
Forward Euler scheme :eq:`decay:FE`
we replace :math:`n` by :math:`n+1` in :eq:`decay:BE0` and solve for the
unknown value :math:`u^{n+1}`:

.. _Eq:decay:BE:

.. math::
   :label: decay:BE
        
        u^{n+1} = \frac{1}{1+ a(t_{n+1}-t_n)} u^n,\quad n=0,\ldots,N_t-1{\thinspace .}
        
        

.. _decay:schemes:CN:

The Crank-Nicolson scheme
-------------------------

.. index:: Crank-Nicolson scheme

.. index:: centered difference

.. index::
   single: finite differences; centered

The finite difference approximations
:eq:`decay:FEdiff` and :eq:`decay:BEdiff` used to derive the schemes
:eq:`decay:FE` and :eq:`decay:BE`, respectively,
are both one-sided differences, i.e.,
we collect information either forward or backward in time when approximating
the derivative at a point. Such one-sided differences are
known to be less accurate than central (or midpoint)
differences, where we use information both forward and backward in
time. A natural next step is therefore to construct
a central difference approximation that will yield a more accurate
numerical solution.

The central difference approximation to the derivative is sought at the
point :math:`t_{n+\frac{1}{2}}=\frac{1}{2} (t_n + t_{n+1})` (or
:math:`t_{n+\frac{1}{2}}=(n+\frac{1}{2})\Delta t` if the mesh spacing is uniform in time).
The approximation reads

.. _Eq:decay:CNdiff:

.. math::
   :label: decay:CNdiff
        
        u^{\prime}(t_{n+\frac{1}{2}}) \approx \frac{u^{n+1}-u^n}{t_{n+1}-t_n}{\thinspace .}
        
        

Figure :ref:`decay:sketch:CN` sketches the geometric interpretation of
such a centered difference.
Note that the fraction on the right-hand side is the same as for the
Forward Euler approximation :eq:`decay:FEdiff` and
the Backward Euler approximation :eq:`decay:BEdiff` (with
:math:`n` replaced by :math:`n+1`). The accuracy of this fraction as an approximation
to the derivative of :math:`u` depends on *where* we seek the derivative:
in the center of the interval :math:`[t_{n},t_{n+1}]` or at the end points.
We shall later see that it is more accurate at the center point.

.. _decay:sketch:CN:

.. figure:: fd_centered_CN.png
   :width: 400

   *Illustration of a centered difference*

With the formula :eq:`decay:CNdiff`, where :math:`u^{\prime}` is evaluated at
:math:`t_{n+\frac{1}{2}}`, it is natural to demand the
ODE to be fulfilled at the time points *between* the mesh points:

.. _Eq:decay:step2m:

.. math::
   :label: decay:step2m
        
        u^{\prime}(t_{n+\frac{1}{2}}) = -au(t_{n+\frac{1}{2}}),\quad n=0,
        \ldots,N_t-1{\thinspace .}
        
        

Using :eq:`decay:CNdiff` in :eq:`decay:step2m` results in
the approximate discrete equation

.. _Eq:decay:CN0:

.. math::
   :label: decay:CN0
        
        \frac{u^{n+1}-u^n}{t_{n+1}-t_n} = -au^{n+\frac{1}{2}},\quad n=0,\ldots,N_t-1,
        
        

where :math:`u^{n+\frac{1}{2}}` is a short form for the numerical approximation
to :math:`u(t_{n+\frac{1}{2}})`.

There is a fundamental problem with the right-hand side of
:eq:`decay:CN0`: we aim to compute :math:`u^n` for integer :math:`n`, which means
that :math:`u^{n+\frac{1}{2}}` is not a quantity computed by our method. The
quantity must
therefore be
expressed by the quantities that we actually produce, i.e.,
the numerical solution at the
mesh points. One possibility is to approximate :math:`u^{n+\frac{1}{2}}`
as an arithmetic mean of the :math:`u` values at the neighboring mesh points:

.. index::
   single: averaging; arithmetic

.. _Eq:decay:uhalfavg:

.. math::
   :label: decay:uhalfavg
        
        u^{n+\frac{1}{2}} \approx \frac{1}{2} (u^n + u^{n+1}){\thinspace .}
        
        

Using :eq:`decay:uhalfavg` in :eq:`decay:CN0` results in a new
approximate discrete equation

.. _Eq:decay:CN1:

.. math::
   :label: decay:CN1
        
        \frac{u^{n+1}-u^n}{t_{n+1}-t_n} = -a\frac{1}{2} (u^n + u^{n+1}){\thinspace .}
        
        

There are three approximation steps leading to this formula:
1) the ODE is only valid at discrete points (between the mesh points),
2) the derivative is approximated by a finite difference, and 3) the
value of :math:`u` between mesh points is approximated by an arithmetic mean
value. Despite one more approximation than for the Backward and Forward
Euler schemes, the use of a centered difference leads to a more
accurate method.

To formulate a recursive algorithm,
we assume that :math:`u^n` is already computed so that :math:`u^{n+1}` is the
unknown, which we can solve for:

.. _Eq:decay:CN:

.. math::
   :label: decay:CN
        
        u^{n+1} = \frac{1-\frac{1}{2} a(t_{n+1}-t_n)}{1 + \frac{1}{2} a(t_{n+1}-t_n)}u^n{\thinspace .}
        
        

The finite difference scheme :eq:`decay:CN` is often called
the Crank-Nicolson (CN) scheme or a midpoint or centered scheme.
Note that :eq:`decay:CN` as well as :eq:`decay:FE` and :eq:`decay:BE`
apply whether the spacing in the time mesh, :math:`t_{n+1}-t_n`, depends on :math:`n`
or is constant.

.. _decay:schemes:theta:

The unifying :math:`\theta`-rule
--------------------------------

.. index:: weighted average

.. index:: theta-rule

.. index:: theta-rule

The Forward Euler, Backward Euler, and Crank-Nicolson schemes can be
formulated as one scheme with a varying parameter :math:`\theta`:

.. _Eq:decay:th0:

.. math::
   :label: decay:th0
        
        \frac{u^{n+1}-u^{n}}{t_{n+1}-t_n} = -a (\theta u^{n+1} + (1-\theta) u^{n})
        
        {\thinspace .}
        

Observe:

 * :math:`\theta =0` gives the Forward Euler scheme

 * :math:`\theta =1` gives the Backward Euler scheme, and

 * :math:`\theta =\frac{1}{2}` gives the Crank-Nicolson scheme.

We shall later, in the section :ref:`decay:analysis`, learn the pros and cons
of the three alternatives.
One may alternatively choose any other value of :math:`\theta` in :math:`[0,1]`, but
this is not so common since the accuracy and stability of
the scheme do not improve compared
to the values :math:`\theta=0,1,\frac{1}{2}`.

As before, :math:`u^n` is considered known and :math:`u^{n+1}` unknown, so
we solve for the latter:

.. _Eq:decay:th:

.. math::
   :label: decay:th
        
        u^{n+1} = \frac{1 - (1-\theta) a(t_{n+1}-t_n)}{1 + \theta a(t_{n+1}-t_n)}{\thinspace .}
        
        

This scheme is known as the :math:`\theta`-rule, or alternatively written as
the "theta-rule".


.. admonition:: Derivation

   We start with replacing :math:`u^{\prime}` by the fraction
   
   .. math::
            \frac{u^{n+1}-u^{n}}{t_{n+1}-t_n},
   
   in the Forward Euler, Backward Euler,
   and Crank-Nicolson schemes. Then we observe that
   the difference between the methods concerns which point this
   fraction approximates the derivative. Or in other words, at which point we
   sample the ODE. So far this has been the
   end points or the midpoint of :math:`[t_n,t_{n+1}]`. However, we may choose any point
   :math:`\tilde t \in [t_n,t_{n+1}]`.
   The difficulty
   is that evaluating the right-hand side :math:`-au` at an arbitrary point
   faces the same problem as in
   the section :ref:`decay:schemes:CN`: the point value must be expressed
   by the discrete :math:`u` quantities that we compute by the scheme, i.e.,
   :math:`u^n` and :math:`u^{n+1}`. Following the averaging idea from
   the section :ref:`decay:schemes:CN`,
   the value of :math:`u` at an arbitrary point :math:`\tilde t` can be
   calculated as a *weighted average*, which generalizes the arithmetic mean
   :math:`\frac{1}{2} u^n + {\frac{1}{2}}u^{n+1}`.
   The weighted average reads
   
   .. _Eq:decay:thetaavg_u:

.. math::
   :label: decay:thetaavg_u
           
           u(\tilde t) \approx \theta u^{n+1} + (1-\theta) u^{n},
           
           
   
   where :math:`\theta\in [0,1]` is a weighting factor.
   We can also express :math:`\tilde t` as a similar weighted average
   
   .. _Eq:decay:thetaavg_t:

.. math::
   :label: decay:thetaavg_t
           
           \tilde t \approx \theta t_{n+1} + (1-\theta) t_{n}{\thinspace .}
           
           
   
   Let now the ODE hold at the point
   :math:`\tilde t\in [t_n,t_{n+1}]`, approximate :math:`u^{\prime}` by the fraction
   :math:`(u^{n+1}-u^{n})/(t_{n+1}-t_n)`, and approximate the right-hand
   side :math:`-au` by the weighted average :eq:`decay:thetaavg_u`.
   The result is :eq:`decay:th0`.




Constant time step
------------------

All schemes up to now have been formulated for a general non-uniform
mesh in time: :math:`t_0 < t_1 < \cdots < t_{N_t}`.
Non-uniform meshes are highly relevant
since one can use many points in regions where :math:`u` varies rapidly, and
fewer points in regions where :math:`u` is slowly varying. This idea saves
the total number of points and therefore makes it faster to compute the mesh
function :math:`u^n`. Non-uniform meshes are used together with
*adaptive* methods that are able to adjust the time mesh during
the computations (the section :ref:`decay:fd2:adaptiveRK` applies
adaptive methods).

.. index:: time step

However, a uniformly distributed set of mesh points is not only
convenient, but also
sufficient for many applications. Therefore, it is a very common
choice. We shall
present the finite difference schemes for a uniform point distribution
:math:`t_n=n\Delta t`, where :math:`\Delta t` is the constant spacing between
the mesh points, also referred to as the *time step*.
The resulting formulas look simpler and are more
well known.

It is not accidental that we focus on presenting the Forward Euler, Backward
Euler, and Crank-Nicolson schemes. They complement each other with their
different pros and cons, thus providing a useful collection of
solution methods for many differential equation problems.
The unifying notation of the :math:`\theta`-rule makes it convenient to
work with all three methods through just one formula.

Mathematical derivation of finite difference formulas
-----------------------------------------------------

The finite difference formulas for approximating the first derivative
of a function have so far been somewhat justified through graphical
illustrations in Figures :ref:`decay:sketch:FE`, :ref:`decay:sketch:BE`,
and :ref:`decay:sketch:CN`. The task is to approximate the derivative
at a point of a curve using only two function values. By drawing
a straight line through the points, we have some approximation to
the tangent of the curve and use the slope of this line as
an approximation to the derivative. The slope can be computed by
inspecting the figures.

However, we can alternatively derive the finite difference formulas by
pure mathematics. The key tool for this approach is Taylor series,
or more precisely, approximation of functions by lower-order
Taylor polynomials. Given a function :math:`f(x)` that is sufficiently
smooth (i.e., :math:`f(x)` has "enough derivatives"),
a Taylor polynomial of degree :math:`m` can be used to approximate the
value of the function :math:`f(x)` if we know the values of :math:`f` and its
first :math:`m` derivatives at some other point :math:`x=a`. The formula for the
Taylor polynomial reads

.. math::
        
        f(x)  \approx f(a) + f'(a)(x-a) + \frac{1}{2}f''(a)(x-a)^2 +
        \frac{1}{6}f'''(a)(x-a)^3 + \cdots \nonumber
        

.. math::
          
         \quad + \frac{1}{m!}\frac{df^{(m)}}{dx^m}(a)(x-a)^m{\thinspace .}
        

For a function of time, :math:`f(t)`, related to a mesh with spacing :math:`\Delta t`,
we often need the Taylor polynomial approximation at :math:`f(t_n\pm\Delta t)`
given :math:`f` and its derivatives at :math:`t=t_n`. Replacing :math:`x` by :math:`t_n+\Delta t` and
:math:`a` by :math:`t_n` gives

.. math::
        
        f(t_n+\Delta t)  \approx f(t_n) + f'(t_n)\Delta t + \frac{1}{2}f''(t_n)
        \Delta t^2 +
        \frac{1}{6}f'''(t_n)\Delta t^3 + \cdots\nonumber
        

.. _Eq:decay:taylor:FE1:

.. math::
   :label: decay:taylor:FE1
          
        \quad + \frac{1}{m!}\frac{df^{(m)}}{dx^m}(t_n)\Delta t^m{\thinspace .}
        
        

The forward difference
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We can use :eq:`decay:taylor:FE1` to find an approximation for
:math:`f'(t_n)` simply by solving with respect to this quantity:

.. math::
        
        f'(t_n)  \approx  \frac{f(t_n+\Delta t) - f(t_n)}{\Delta t}
        - \frac{1}{2}f''(t_n)\Delta t -
        \frac{1}{6}f'''(t_n)\Delta t^2 + \cdots\nonumber
        

.. _Eq:decay:taylor:FE2:

.. math::
   :label: decay:taylor:FE2
          
        \quad - \frac{1}{m!}\frac{df^{(m)}}{dx^m}(t_n)\Delta t^{m-1}{\thinspace .}
        
        

By letting :math:`m\rightarrow\infty`, this formula is exact, but that is not
so much of practical value. A more interesting observation is that
all the power terms in :math:`\Delta t` vanish as :math:`\Delta t\rightarrow 0`, i.e.,
the formula

.. _Eq:decay:taylor:FE3:

.. math::
   :label: decay:taylor:FE3
        
        f'(t_n) \approx \frac{f(t_n+\Delta t) - f(t_n)}{\Delta t}
        
        

is exact in the limit :math:`\Delta t\rightarrow 0`.

The interesting feature of :eq:`decay:taylor:FE2` is that we have
a measure of the error in the formula :eq:`decay:taylor:FE3`: the
error is given by the extra terms on the right-hand side of
:eq:`decay:taylor:FE2`. We assume that :math:`\Delta t` is a small quantity
(:math:`\Delta t\ll 1`).
Then :math:`\Delta t^2\ll\Delta t`, :math:`\Delta t^3\ll \Delta t^2`, and so on,
which means that the first term is the dominating term. This first
term reads :math:`-\frac{1}{2}f''(t_n)\Delta t` and can be taken as a
measure of the error in the Forward Euler formula.

The backward difference
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To derive the backward difference, we use the Taylor polynomial
approximation at :math:`f(t_n-\Delta t)`:

.. math::
        
        f(t_n-\Delta t) \approx f(t_n) - f'(t_n)\Delta t + \frac{1}{2}f''(t_n)
        \Delta t^2 -
        \frac{1}{6}f'''(t_n)\Delta t^3+ \cdots\nonumber
        

.. _Eq:decay:taylor:BE1:

.. math::
   :label: decay:taylor:BE1
          
        \quad + \frac{1}{m!}\frac{df^{(m)}}{dx^m}(t_n)\Delta t^m{\thinspace .}
        
        

Solving with respect to :math:`f'(t_n)` gives

.. math::
        
        f'(t_n) \approx \frac{f(t_n) - f(t_n-\Delta t)}{\Delta t}
        + \frac{1}{2}f''(t_n)\Delta t -
        \frac{1}{6}f'''(t_n)\Delta t^2+ \cdots\nonumber
        

.. _Eq:decay:taylor:BE2:

.. math::
   :label: decay:taylor:BE2
          
        \quad - \frac{1}{m!}\frac{df^{(m)}}{dx^m}(t_n)\Delta t^{m-1}{\thinspace .}
        
        

The term :math:`\frac{1}{2}f''(t_n)\Delta t` can be taken as a simple measure of
the approximation error since it will dominate over the other terms
as :math:`\Delta t\rightarrow 0`.

The centered difference
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The centered difference approximates the derivative at
:math:`t_n+\frac{1}{2}\Delta t`. Let us write up the Taylor polynomial
approximations to :math:`f(t_n)` and :math:`f(t_{n+1})` around :math:`t_n+\frac{1}{2}\Delta t`:

.. math::
        
        f(t_n) \approx f(t_n+\frac{1}{2}\Delta t) -
        f'(t_n+\frac{1}{2}\Delta t)\frac{1}{2}\Delta t +
        f''(t_n+\frac{1}{2}\Delta t)(\frac{1}{2}\Delta t)^2 -\nonumber
        

.. math::
          
         \quad f'''(t_n+\frac{1}{2}\Delta t)(\frac{1}{2}\Delta t)^3 + \cdots
        

.. math::
          
        f(t_{n+1})  \approx f(t_n+\frac{1}{2}\Delta t) +
        f'(t_n+\frac{1}{2}\Delta t)\frac{1}{2}\Delta t +
        f''(t_n+\frac{1}{2}\Delta t)(\frac{1}{2}\Delta t)^2 +\nonumber
        

.. math::
          
        \quad f'''(t_n+\frac{1}{2}\Delta t)(\frac{1}{2}\Delta t)^3 + \cdots
        

Subtracting the first from the second gives

.. _Eq:decay:taylor:CN2:

.. math::
   :label: decay:taylor:CN2
        
        f(t_{n+1}) - f(t_n) = f'(t_n+\frac{1}{2}\Delta t)\Delta t
        + 2f'''(t_n+\frac{1}{2}\Delta t)(\frac{1}{2}\Delta t)^3 + \cdots
        
        

Solving with respect to :math:`f'(t_n+\frac{1}{2}\Delta t)` results
in

.. _Eq:decay:taylor:CN3:

.. math::
   :label: decay:taylor:CN3
        
        f'(t_n+\frac{1}{2}\Delta t) \approx \frac{f(t_{n+1}) - f(t_n)}{\Delta t}
        - \frac{1}{4}f'''(t_n+\frac{1}{2}\Delta t)\Delta t^2 + c
        \cdots
        
        

This time the error measure goes like :math:`\frac{1}{4}f'''\Delta t^2`, i.e.,
it is proportional to :math:`\Delta t^2` and not only :math:`\Delta t`, which means
that the error goes faster to zero as :math:`\Delta t` is reduced.
This means that the centered difference formula

.. _Eq:decay:taylor:CN4:

.. math::
   :label: decay:taylor:CN4
        
        f'(t_n+\frac{1}{2}\Delta t) \approx \frac{f(t_{n+1}) - f(t_n)}{\Delta t}
        
        

is more accurate than the forward and backward differences for small
:math:`\Delta t`.

.. _decay:fd:op:

Compact operator notation for finite differences
------------------------------------------------

.. index:: finite difference operator notation

.. index::
   single: operator notation, finite differences

Finite difference formulas can be tedious to write and read,
especially for differential equations with many terms and many
derivatives. To save space and help the reader spot
the nature of the difference approximations, we introduce a
compact notation. For a function :math:`u(t)`,
a forward difference approximation is denoted
by the :math:`D_t^+` operator and written as

.. _Eq:fd:D:f:

.. math::
   :label: fd:D:f
        
        [D_t^+u]^n = \frac{u^{n+1} - u^{n}}{\Delta t}
        \ \left( \approx \frac{d}{dt} u(t_n)\right) 
        {\thinspace .}
        

The notation consists of an operator that approximates
differentiation with respect to an independent variable, here :math:`t`.
The operator is built of the symbol :math:`D`, with the
independent variable as subscript
and a superscript denoting the type of difference. The superscript :math:`\,{}^+`
indicates a forward difference.
We place square brackets around the operator and the function it operates
on and specify the mesh point, where the operator is acting, by
a superscript after the closing bracket.

The corresponding operator notation for a centered difference and
a backward difference reads

.. _Eq:fd:D:c:

.. math::
   :label: fd:D:c
        
        [D_tu]^n = \frac{u^{n+\frac{1}{2}} - u^{n-\frac{1}{2}}}{\Delta t}
        \approx \frac{d}{dt} u(t_n), 
        

and

.. _Eq:fd:D:b:

.. math::
   :label: fd:D:b
        
        [D_t^-u]^n = \frac{u^{n} - u^{n-1}}{\Delta t}
        \approx \frac{d}{dt} u(t_n) 
        {\thinspace .}
        

Note that the superscript :math:`\,{}^-` denotes the backward
difference, while no superscript implies a central difference.

An averaging operator is also convenient to have:

.. _Eq:fd:mean:a:

.. math::
   :label: fd:mean:a
        
        [\overline{u}^{t}]^n = \frac{1}{2} (u^{n-\frac{1}{2}} + u^{n+\frac{1}{2}} )
        \approx u(t_n) 
        

The superscript :math:`t` indicates that the average is taken along the time
coordinate. The common average :math:`(u^n + u^{n+1})/2` can now be
expressed as :math:`[\overline{u}^{t}]^{n+\frac{1}{2}}`. (When also spatial coordinates
enter the problem, we need the explicit specification of the coordinate
after the bar.)

With our compact notation, the Backward Euler finite difference approximation to :math:`u^{\prime}=-au` can be written
as

.. math::
        
        [D_t^-u]^n = -au^n {\thinspace .}
        

In difference equations we often place the square brackets around
the whole equation, to indicate at which mesh point the equation applies,
since each term must be approximated at the same point:

.. math::
        
        [D_t^- u  = -au]^n {\thinspace .}
        

Similarly, the Forward Euler scheme takes the form

.. math::
        
        [D_t^+ u  = -au]^n,
        

while the Crank-Nicolson scheme is written as

.. _Eq:fd:compact:ex:CN:

.. math::
   :label: fd:compact:ex:CN
        
        [D_t u = -a\overline{u}^t]^{n+\frac{1}{2}}{\thinspace .}
        
        


.. admonition:: Question

   By use of :eq:`fd:D:c` and :eq:`fd:mean:a`, are you able to
   write out the expressions in :eq:`fd:compact:ex:CN` to verify that
   it is indeed the Crank-Nicolson scheme?




The :math:`\theta`-rule can be specified in operator notation by

.. _Eq:decay:fd1:op:theta:

.. math::
   :label: decay:fd1:op:theta
        
        [\bar D_t u = -a\overline{u}^{t,\theta}]^{n+\theta},{\thinspace .}
        
        

We define a new time difference

.. _Eq:decay:fd1:Du:theta:

.. math::
   :label: decay:fd1:Du:theta
        
        \lbrack\bar D_t u\rbrack^{n+\theta} = \frac{u^{n+1}-u^n}{t^{n+1}-t^n},
        
        

to be applied at the time point :math:`t_{n+\theta}\approx\theta t_n + (1-\theta)t_{n+1}`. This weighted average gives rise to the
*weighted averaging operator*

.. _Eq:decay:fd1:wmean:a:

.. math::
   :label: decay:fd1:wmean:a
        
        \lbrack\overline{u}^{t,\theta}\rbrack^{n+\theta} = (1-\theta)u^{n} + \theta u^{n+1}
        \approx u(t_{n+\theta}),
        
        

where :math:`\theta\in [0,1]` as usual. Note that for :math:`\theta =\frac{1}{2}` we recover
the standard centered difference and the standard arithmetic mean.
The idea in :eq:`decay:fd1:op:theta` is to sample the equation at
:math:`t_{n+\theta}`, use a non-symmetric difference at that
point :math:`[\bar D_t u]^{n+\theta}`, and a weighted (non-symmetric) mean value.

An alternative and perhaps clearer notation is

.. math::
         [D_t u]^{n+\frac{1}{2}} = \theta [-au]^{n+1} + (1-\theta)[-au]^{n}{\thinspace .} 

Looking at the various examples above and comparing them with the
underlying differential equations, we see immediately which difference
approximations that have been used and at which point they
apply. Therefore, the compact notation effectively communicates the
reasoning behind turning a differential equation into a difference
equation.
