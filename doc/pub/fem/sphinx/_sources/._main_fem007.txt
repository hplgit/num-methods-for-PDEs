A generalized element concept
=============================

So far, finite element computing has employed the ``nodes`` and
``element`` lists together with the definition of the basis functions
in the reference element. Suppose we want to introduce a piecewise
constant approximation with one basis function :math:`{\tilde{\varphi}}_0(x)=1` in
the reference element, corresponding to a :math:`{\varphi}_i(x)` function that
is 1 on element number :math:`i` and zero on all other elements.
Although we could associate the function value
with a node in the middle of the elements, there are no nodes at the
ends, and the previous code snippets will not work because we
cannot find the element boundaries from the ``nodes`` list.

.. _fem:approx:fe:element:terminology:

Cells, vertices, and degrees of freedom
---------------------------------------

.. index:: cell

.. index:: vertex

.. index:: degree of freedom

.. index:: reference cell

We now introduce *cells* as the subdomains :math:`\Omega^{(e)}` previously
referred as elements. The cell boundaries are denoted as *vertices*.
The reason for this name is that cells are recognized by their vertices
in 2D and 3D. We also define a set of *degrees of freedom*, which are
the quantities we aim to compute. The most common type of degree
of freedom is the value of the unknown function :math:`u` at some point.
(For example, we can introduce nodes as before and say the degrees of
freedom are the values of :math:`u` at the nodes.) The basis functions are
constructed so that they equal unity for one particular degree of
freedom and zero for the rest. This property ensures that when
we evaluate :math:`u=\sum_j c_j{\varphi}_j` for degree of freedom number :math:`i`,
we get :math:`u=c_i`. Integrals are performed over cells, usually by
mapping the cell of interest to a *reference cell*.

With the concepts of cells, vertices, and degrees of freedom we
increase the decoupling of the geometry (cell, vertices) from the
space of basis functions. We will associate different
sets of basis functions with a cell. In 1D, all cells are intervals,
while in 2D we can have cells that are triangles with straight sides,
or any polygon, or in fact any two-dimensional geometry. Triangles and
quadrilaterals are most common, though. The popular cell types in 3D
are tetrahedra and hexahedra.

Extended finite element concept
-------------------------------

.. index::
   single: finite element, definition

.. index:: dof map

The concept of a *finite element* is now

  * a *reference cell* in a local reference coordinate system;

  * a set of *basis functions* :math:`{\tilde{\varphi}}_i` defined on the cell;

  * a set of *degrees of freedom* that uniquely determines
    the basis functions such that :math:`{\tilde{\varphi}}_i=1` for degree of freedom
    number :math:`i` and :math:`{\tilde{\varphi}}_i=0` for all other degrees of freedom;

  * a mapping between local and global degree of freedom numbers,
    here called the *dof map*;

  * a geometric *mapping* of the reference cell onto to cell in the physical
    domain.

There must be a geometric description of a cell. This is trivial in 1D
since the cell is an interval and is described by the interval limits,
here called vertices. If the cell is :math:`\Omega^{(e)}=[x_L,x_R]`,
vertex 0 is :math:`x_L` and vertex 1 is :math:`x_R`. The reference cell in 1D
is :math:`[-1,1]` in the reference coordinate system :math:`X`.

.. index::
   single: finite element expansion; reference element

The expansion of :math:`u` over one cell is often used:

.. math::
        
        u(x) = \tilde u(X) = \sum_{r} c_r{\tilde{\varphi}}_r(X),\quad x\in\Omega^{(e)},\ 
        X\in [-1,1],
        

where the sum is taken over the numbers of the degrees of freedom and
:math:`c_r` is the value of :math:`u` for degree of freedom number :math:`r`.

Our previous P1, P2, etc., elements are defined by introducing :math:`d+1`
equally spaced nodes in the reference cell and saying that the degrees
of freedom are the :math:`d+1` function values at these nodes.  The basis
functions must be 1 at one node and 0 at the others, and the Lagrange
polynomials have exactly this property.  The nodes can be numbered
from left to right with associated degrees of freedom that are
numbered in the same way.  The degree of freedom mapping becomes what
was previously represented by the ``elements`` lists.  The cell mapping
is the same affine mapping :ref:`(5.6) <Eq:fem:approx:fe:affine:mapping>` as
before.

.. _fem:approx:fe:element:impl:

Implementation  (2)
-------------------

.. index:: cells list

.. index:: vertices list

.. index:: dof_map list

Implementationwise,

  * we replace ``nodes`` by ``vertices``;

  * we introduce ``cells`` such that ``cell[e][r]`` gives the mapping
    from local vertex ``r`` in cell ``e`` to the global vertex number
    in ``vertices``;

  * we replace ``elements`` by ``dof_map`` (the contents are the same
    for Pd elements).

Consider the example from the section :ref:`fem:approx:fe:def:elements:nodes`
where :math:`\Omega =[0,1]` is divided into two cells,
:math:`\Omega^{(0)}=[0,0.4]` and :math:`\Omega^{(1)}=[0.4,1]`, as
depicted in Figure :ref:`fem:approx:fe:def:elements:nodes:fig:P2`.
The vertices are :math:`[0,0.4,1]`. Local vertex 0 and 1 are
:math:`0` and :math:`0.4` in cell 0 and :math:`0.4` and :math:`1` in cell 1.
A P2 element means that the degrees of freedom are
the value of :math:`u` at three equally spaced points (nodes) in each
cell. The data structures become

.. code-block:: python

        vertices = [0, 0.4, 1]
        cells = [[0, 1], [1, 2]]
        dof_map = [[0, 1, 2], [2, 3, 4]]

If we would approximate :math:`f` by piecewise constants, known as
P0 elements, we simply
introduce one point or node in an element, preferably :math:`X=0`,
and define one degree of freedom, which is the function value
at this node. Moreover, we set :math:`{\tilde{\varphi}}_0(X)=1`.
The ``cells`` and ``vertices`` arrays remain the same, but
``dof_map`` is altered:

.. code-block:: python

        dof_map = [[0], [1]]

We use the ``cells`` and ``vertices`` lists to retrieve information
on the geometry of a cell, while ``dof_map`` is the
:math:`q(e,r)` mapping introduced earlier in the
assembly of element matrices and vectors.
For example, the ``Omega_e`` variable (representing the cell interval)
in previous code snippets must now be computed as

.. code-block:: python

        Omega_e = [vertices[cells[e][0], vertices[cells[e][1]]

The assembly is done by

.. code-block:: python

        A[dof_map[e][r], dof_map[e][s]] += A_e[r,s]
        b[dof_map[e][r]] += b_e[r]

We will hereafter drop the ``nodes`` and ``elements`` arrays
and work exclusively with ``cells``, ``vertices``, and ``dof_map``.
The module ``fe_approx1D_numint.py`` now replaces the module
``fe_approx1D`` and offers similar functions that work with
the new concepts:

.. code-block:: python

        from fe_approx1D_numint import *
        x = sp.Symbol('x')
        f = x*(1 - x)
        N_e = 10
        vertices, cells, dof_map = mesh_uniform(N_e, d=3, Omega=[0,1])
        phi = [basis(len(dof_map[e])-1) for e in range(N_e)]
        A, b = assemble(vertices, cells, dof_map, phi, f)
        c = np.linalg.solve(A, b)
        # Make very fine mesh and sample u(x) on this mesh for plotting
        x_u, u = u_glob(c, vertices, cells, dof_map,
                        resolution_per_element=51)
        plot(x_u, u)

These steps are offered in the ``approximate`` function, which we here
apply to see how well four P0 elements (piecewise constants)
can approximate a parabola:

.. code-block:: python

        from fe_approx1D_numint import *
        x=sp.Symbol("x")
        for N_e in 4, 8:
            approximate(x*(1-x), d=0, N_e=N_e, Omega=[0,1])

Figure :ref:`fem:approx:fe:element:impl:fig:P0:x2` shows the result.

.. _fem:approx:fe:element:impl:fig:P0:x2:

   :width: 600

   *Approximation of a parabola by 4 (left) and 8 (right) P0 elements*

.. _fem:approx:fe:element:impl:error:

Computing the error of the approximation
----------------------------------------

So far we have focused on computing the coefficients :math:`c_j` in the
approximation :math:`u(x)=\sum_jc_j{\varphi}_j` as well as on plotting :math:`u` and
:math:`f` for visual comparison. A more quantitative comparison needs to
investigate the error :math:`e(x)=f(x)-u(x)`. We mostly want a single number to
reflect the error and use a norm for this purpose, usually the :math:`L^2` norm

.. math::
         ||e||_{L^2} = \left(\int_{\Omega} e^2 dx\right)^{1/2}{\thinspace .}

Since the finite element approximation is defined for all :math:`x\in\Omega`,
and we are interested in how :math:`u(x)` deviates from :math:`f(x)` through all
the elements,
we can either integrate analytically or use an accurate numerical
approximation. The latter is more convenient as it is a generally
feasible and simple approach. The idea is to sample :math:`e(x)`
at a large number of points in each element. The function ``u_glob``
in the ``fe_approx1D_numint`` module does this for :math:`u(x)` and returns
an array ``x`` with coordinates and an array ``u`` with the :math:`u` values:

.. code-block:: python

        x, u = u_glob(c, vertices, cells, dof_map,
                      resolution_per_element=101)
        e = f(x) - u

Let us use the Trapezoidal method to approximate the integral. Because
different elements may have different lengths, the ``x`` array has
a non-uniformly distributed set of coordinates. Also, the ``u_glob``
function works in an element by element fashion such that coordinates
at the boundaries between elements appear twice. We therefore need
to use a "raw" version of the Trapezoidal rule where we just add up
all the trapezoids:

.. math::
         \int_\Omega g(x) dx \approx \sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \frac{1}{2}(g(x_j) +
        g(x_{j+1}))(x_{j+1}-x_j),

if :math:`x_0,\ldots,x_n` are all the coordinates in ``x``. In
vectorized Python code,

.. code-block:: python

        g_x = g(x)
        integral = 0.5*np.sum((g_x[:-1] + g_x[1:])*(x[1:] - x[:-1]))

Computing the :math:`L^2` norm of the error, here named ``E``, is now achieved by

.. code-block:: python

        e2 = e**2
        E = np.sqrt(0.5*np.sum((e2[:-1] + e2[1:])*(x[1:] - x[:-1]))


.. admonition:: How does the error depend on :math:`h` and :math:`d`

   Theory and experiments show that the least squares or projection/Galerkin
   method in combination with Pd elements of equal length :math:`h` has an error
   
   .. _Eq:fem:approx:fe:error:theorem:

.. math::
   :label: fem:approx:fe:error:theorem
           
           ||e||_{L^2} = Ch^{d+1},
           
           
   
   where :math:`C` is a constant depending on :math:`f`, but not on :math:`h` or :math:`d`.




.. _fem:approx:fe:element:impl:Hermite:

Example: Cubic Hermite polynomials
----------------------------------

.. index:: Hermite polynomials

The finite elements considered so far represent :math:`u` as piecewise
polynomials with discontinuous derivatives at the cell boundaries.
Sometimes it is desirable to have continuous derivatives. A primary
examples is the solution of differential equations with fourth-order
derivatives where standard finite element formulations lead to
a need for basis functions with continuous first-order derivatives.
The most common type of such basis functions in 1D is the
so-called cubic Hermite polynomials.
The construction of such polynomials, as explained next, will further
exemplify the concepts of a cell, vertex, degree of freedom, and dof map.

Given a reference cell :math:`[-1,1]`, we seek cubic polynomials
with the values of the *function* and its *first-order derivative* at
:math:`X=-1` and :math:`X=1` as the four degrees of freedom. Let us number
the degrees of freedom as

  * 0: value of function at :math:`X=-1`

  * 1: value of first derivative at :math:`X=-1`

  * 2: value of function at :math:`X=1`

  * 3: value of first derivative at :math:`X=1`

By having the derivatives as unknowns, we ensure that
the derivative of a basis function in two neighboring elements
is the same at the node points.

The four basis functions can be written in a general form

.. math::
         {\tilde{\varphi}}_i (X) = \sum_{j=0}^3 C_{i,j}X^j, 

with four coefficients :math:`C_{i,j}`, :math:`j=0,1,2,3`, to be determined for
each :math:`i`. The constraints
that basis function number :math:`i` must be 1 for degree of
freedom number :math:`i` and zero for the other three degrees of freedom,
gives four equations to determine :math:`C_{i,j}` for each :math:`i`. In mathematical
detail,

.. math::
        
        {\tilde{\varphi}}_0 (-1) &= 1,\quad {\tilde{\varphi}}_0 (1)={\tilde{\varphi}}_0'(-1)={\tilde{\varphi}}_i' (1)=0,\\ 
        {\tilde{\varphi}}_1' (-1) &= 1,\quad {\tilde{\varphi}}_1 (-1)={\tilde{\varphi}}_1(1)={\tilde{\varphi}}_1' (1)=0,\\ 
        {\tilde{\varphi}}_2 (1) &= 1,\quad {\tilde{\varphi}}_2 (-1)={\tilde{\varphi}}_2'(-1)={\tilde{\varphi}}_2' (1)=0,\\ 
        {\tilde{\varphi}}_3' (1) &= 1,\quad {\tilde{\varphi}}_3 (-1)={\tilde{\varphi}}_3'(-1)={\tilde{\varphi}}_3 (1)=0
        {\thinspace .}
        

These four :math:`4\times 4` linear equations can be solved, yielding the
following formulas
for the cubic basis functions:

.. math::
        
        {\tilde{\varphi}}_0(X) = 1 - \frac{3}{4}(X+1)^2 + \frac{1}{4}(X+1)^3
        

.. math::
          
        {\tilde{\varphi}}_1(X) = -(X+1)(1 - \frac{1}{2}(X+1))^2
        

.. math::
          
        {\tilde{\varphi}}_2(X) = \frac{3}{4}(X+1)^2 - \frac{1}{2}(X+1)^3
        

.. math::
          
        {\tilde{\varphi}}_3(X) = -\frac{1}{2}(X+1)(\frac{1}{2}(X+1)^2 - (X+1))
        

.. math::
          
        

The construction of the dof map needs a scheme for numbering the
global degrees of freedom. A natural left-to-right numbering
has the function value at vertex :math:`x_{i}`
as degree of freedom number :math:`2i` and the value of the derivative
at :math:`x_{i}` as degree of freedom number :math:`2i+1`, :math:`i=0,\ldots,N_e+1`.
