Exercise 4: Approximate the exponential function by power functions
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Let :math:`V` be a function space with basis functions :math:`x^i`,
:math:`i=0,1,\ldots,N`.  Find the best approximation to :math:`f(x)=\exp(-x)` on

Exercise 5: Approximate the sine function by power functions
------------------------------------------------------------

In this exercise we want to approximate the sine function by polynomials
of order :math:`N+1`. Consider two bases:

.. math::
        
        V_1 &= \{x, x^3, x^5, \ldots, x^{N-2}, x^N \}, \\ 
        V_2 &= \{1,x,x^2,x^3,\ldots, x^N\}{\thinspace .}
        

The basis :math:`V_1` is motivated by the fact that the Taylor polynomial
approximation to the sine function has only odd powers, while :math:`V_2`
is motivated by the assumption that also the even powers could
improve the approximation in a least-squares setting.

Compute the best approximation to :math:`f(x)=\sin(x)` among all functions in :math:`V_1`
and :math:`V_2` on two domains of increasing sizes:
:math:`\Omega_{1,k} = [0, k\pi]`, :math:`k=2,3\ldots,6` and
:math:`\Omega_{2,k} = [-k\pi /2, k\pi/2]`, :math:`k=2,3\ldots,6`.
Make plots for all combinations of :math:`V_1`, :math:`V_2`, :math:`\Omega_1`, :math:`\Omega_2`,
:math:`k=2,3,\ldots,6`.

Add a plot of the :math:`N`-th degree Taylor polynomial approximation of
:math:`\sin(x)` around :math:`x=0`.

.. --- begin hint in exercise ---

**Hint.**
You can make a loop over :math:`V_1` and :math:`V_2`, a loop over
:math:`\Omega_1` and :math:`\Omega_2`, and a loop over :math:`k`. Inside the loops,
call the functions ``least_squares`` and
``comparison_plot`` from the ``approx1D`` module.
:math:`N=9` is a suggested value.

Exercise 6: Approximate a steep function by sines
-------------------------------------------------

Find the best approximation of :math:`f(x) = \tanh (s(x-\pi))` on
:math:`[0, 2\pi]` in the space :math:`V` with basis
:math:`{\psi}_i(x) = \sin((2i+1)x)`, :math:`i\in{\mathcal{I}_s} = \{0,\ldots,N\}`.
Make a movie showing how :math:`u=\sum_{j\in{\mathcal{I}_s}}c_j{\psi}_j(x)`
approximates :math:`f(x)` as :math:`N` grows. Choose :math:`s` such that :math:`f` is
steep (:math:`s=20` may be appropriate).

.. --- begin hint in exercise ---

**Hint.**
One may naively call the ``least_squares_orth`` and ``comparison_plot``
from the ``approx1D`` module in a loop and extend the basis with
one new element in each pass. This approach
implies a lot of recomputations.
A more efficient strategy is to let ``least_squares_orth``
compute with only one basis function at a time and accumulate
the corresponding ``u`` in the total solution.

Remarks
~~~~~~~

Approximation of a discontinuous (or steep) :math:`f(x)` by sines,
results in slow convergence and oscillatory behavior of the
approximation close to the abrupt changes in :math:`f`.
This is known as the `Gibb's phenomenon <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibbs_phenomenon>`__.

.. _fem:approx:exer:Fourier:

Exercise 8: Fourier series as a least squares approximation
-----------------------------------------------------------

Given a function :math:`f(x)` on an interval :math:`[0,L]`, look up the formula
for the coefficients :math:`a_j` and :math:`b_j` in the Fourier series of :math:`f`:

.. math::
        
        f(x) = a_0 + \sum_{j=1}^\infty a_j\cos \left(j\frac{\pi x}{L}\right)
        + \sum_{j=1}^\infty b_j\sin \left(j\frac{\pi x}{L}\right){\thinspace .}
        

Let an infinite-dimensional vector space :math:`V` have the basis functions
:math:`\cos j\frac{\pi x}{L}` for :math:`j=0,1,\dots,\infty` and
:math:`\sin j\frac{\pi x}{L}` for :math:`j=1,\dots,\infty`.  Show that the least squares
approximation method from the section :ref:`fem:approx:global` leads to a
linear system whose solution coincides with the standard formulas for
the coefficients in a Fourier series of :math:`f(x)` (see also
the section :ref:`fem:approx:global:Fourier`). You may choose

.. math::
         {\psi}_{2i} = \cos\left( i\frac{\pi}{L}x\right),\quad
        {\psi}_{2i+1} = \sin\left( i\frac{\pi}{L}x\right),

for :math:`i=0,1,\ldots,N\rightarrow\infty`.

Choose :math:`f(x) = \tanh(s(x-\frac{1}{2}))` on :math:`\Omega=[0,1]`, which is
a smooth function, but with considerable steepness around :math:`x=1/2`
as :math:`s` grows in size.
Calculate the coefficients in the Fourier expansion by
solving the linear system, arising from the least squares or Galerkin
methods, by hand. Plot
some truncated versions of the series together with :math:`f(x)` to show how
the series expansion converges for :math:`s=10` and :math:`s=100`.

         f(x) = -\tanh(s(x-\frac{1}{2})),\quad x\in [0,1],

by Lagrange polynomials for :math:`s=10` and :math:`s=100`, and :math:`N=3,6,9,11`.

:math:`[0,1]`, :math:`[1,1.2]`, and :math:`[1.2,2]`.

For P1 and P2 elements, set up the list of coordinates and nodes
(``nodes``) and the numbers of the nodes that belong to each element
(``elements``) in two cases: 1) nodes and elements numbered from left to
right, and 2) nodes and elements numbered from right to left.

Exercise 12: Construct matrix sparsity patterns
-----------------------------------------------

:ref:`fem:approx:fe:exer:mesh1` describes a element mesh
with a total of five elements, but with two different element and
node orderings. For each of the two orderings,
make a :math:`5\times 5` matrix and fill in the entries that will be nonzero.

.. _fem:approx:fe:exer:Asinwt:interpol:error:

Exercise 16: Investigate the approximation error in finite elements
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The theory :ref:`(8.1) <Eq:fem:approx:fe:error:theorem>` from
the section :ref:`fem:approx:fe:error` predicts that the
error in the Pd approximation of a function
should behave as :math:`h^{d+1}`. Use experiments to verify this
asymptotic behavior (i.e., for small enough :math:`h`).
Choose two examples: :math:`f(x)=Ae^{-\omega x}` on :math:`[0,3/\omega]`
and :math:`f(x) = A\sin (\omega x)` on :math:`\Omega=[0, 2\pi/\omega]` for
constants :math:`A` and :math:`\omega`. What happens if you try
:math:`f(x)=\sqrt{x}` on :math:`[0,1]`?

.. --- begin hint in exercise ---

**Hint.**
Run a series of experiments: :math:`(h_i,E_)`, :math:`i=0,\ldots,m`, where :math:`E_i`
is the :math:`L^2` norm of the error corresponding to element length :math:`h_i`.
Assume an error model :math:`E=Ch^r` and compute :math:`r` from two successive
experiments:

.. math::
         r_i = \ln (E_{i+1}/E_i)/\ln (h_{i+1}/h_i),\quad i=0,\ldots,m-1{\thinspace .}

Hopefully, the sequence :math:`r_0,\ldots,r_{m-1}` converges to the true
:math:`r`, and :math:`r_{m-1}` can be taken as an approximation to :math:`r`.

Exercise 17: Approximate a step function by finite elements
-----------------------------------------------------------

Approximate the step function

.. math::
         f(x) = \left\lbrace\begin{array}{ll}
        1 & x < {1/2},\\ 
        2 & x \geq {1/2}
        \end{array}\right.
        

by 2, 4, and 8 P1 and P2 elements. Compare
approximations visually.

.. --- begin hint in exercise ---

**Hint.**
This :math:`f` can also be expressed in terms of the Heaviside function :math:`H(x)`:
:math:`f(x) = H(x-{1/2})`.
Therefore, :math:`f` can be defined by

.. code-block:: python

        f = sp.Heaviside(x -  sp.Rational(1,2))

making the ``approximate`` function in the
``fe_approx1D.py`` module an obvious candidate to solve the
problem. However, ``sympy`` does not handle symbolic integration
with this particular integrand, and the ``approximate`` function faces a problem
when converting ``f`` to a Python function (for plotting) since
``Heaviside`` is not an available function in ``numpy``. It is better to make
special-purpose code for this case or perform all
calculations by hand.

Exercise 18: 2D approximation with orthogonal functions
-------------------------------------------------------

Assume we have basis functions :math:`{\varphi}_i(x,y)` in 2D that are
orthogonal
such that :math:`({\varphi}_i,{\varphi}_j)=0` when :math:`i\neq j`.
The function ``least_squares`` in the
file `approx2D.py <http://tinyurl.com/nm5587k/fem/fe_approx2D.py>`__ will then spend much time on computing off-diagonal terms
in the coefficient matrix that we know are zero.
To speed up the computations, make a
version ``least_squares_orth`` that utilizes the orthogonality among the
basis functions. Apply the function to approximate

.. math::
         f(x,y) = x(1-x)y(1-y)e^{-x-y}

on :math:`\Omega = [0,1]\times [0,1]` via basis functions

Consider approximation of some :math:`f(x)` on an interval :math:`\Omega` using
the least squares or Galerkin methods with P1 elements. Derive
the element matrix and vector using the
Trapezoidal rule :ref:`(9.1) <Eq:fem:approx:fe:numint1:trapez>` for calculating
integrals on the reference element. Assemble the contributions, assuming
a uniform cell partitioning, and show that the resulting linear system

We shall approximate the function

         f(x) = 1 + \epsilon\sin (2\pi nx),\quad x\in \Omega = [0,1],

where :math:`n\in\mathbb{Z}` and :math:`\epsilon \geq 0`.

**a)**
Sketch :math:`f(x)` and find the wave length of the function.

**b)**
We want to use :math:`N_P` elements per wave length. Show that the number
of elements is then :math:`nN_P`.

**c)**
The critical quantity for accuracy is the number of elements per
wave length, not the element size in itself. It therefore suffices
to study an :math:`f` with just one wave length in :math:`\Omega = [0,1]`.
Set :math:`\epsilon = 0.5`.

Run the least squares or projection/Galerkin method for
:math:`N_P=2,4,8,16,32`. Compute the error :math:`E=||u-f||_{L^2}`.

the technique from the section :ref:`fem:approx:fe:element:impl:error` to
compute the norm of the error.

Repeat the set of experiments in the above point, but
use interpolation/collocation based on the node points to
compute :math:`u(x)` (recall that :math:`c_i` is now simply :math:`f(x_{i})`).
Compute the error :math:`E=||u-f||_{L^2}`.
