  <p>In a linear differential equation all terms involving the unknown functions
are linear in the unknown functions or their derivatives. Linear here means that
the unknown function or a derivative of it is multiplied by a number or
a known function. All other differential equations are non-linear.</p>
<p>The easiest way to see if an equation is nonlinear is to spot nonlinear terms
where the unknown functions or their derivatives are multiplied by
each other. For example, in</p>
<div class="math">
\[u^{\prime}(t) = -a(t)u(t) + b(t),\]</div>
<p>the terms involving the unknown function <span class="math">\(u\)</span> are linear: <span class="math">\(u^{\prime}\)</span> contains
the derivative of the unknown function multiplied by unity, and <span class="math">\(au\)</span> contains
the unknown function multiplied by a known function.
However,</p>
<div class="math">
\[u^{\prime}(t) = u(t)(1 - u(t)),\]</div>
<p>is nonlinear because of the term <span class="math">\(-u^2\)</span> where the unknown function is
multiplied by itself. Also</p>
<div class="math">
\[\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + u\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = 0,\]</div>
<p>is nonlinear because of the term <span class="math">\(uu_x\)</span> where the unknown
function appears in a product with itself or one if its derivatives.
Another example of a nonlinear equation is</p>
<div class="math">
\[u^{\prime\prime} + \sin(u) =0,\]</div>
<p>because <span class="math">\(\sin(u)\)</span> contains products of <span class="math">\(u\)</span>,</p>
<div class="math">
\[\sin(u) = u - \frac{1}{3} u^3 + \ldots\]</div>
<div class="admonition-mathematical-proof admonition">
<p class="first admonition-title">Mathematical proof</p>
<p>To really prove mathematically that some differential equation
in an unknown <span class="math">\(u\)</span> is linear,
show for each term <span class="math">\(T(u)\)</span> that with <span class="math">\(u = au_1 + bu_2\)</span> for
constants <span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span>,</p>
<div class="math">
\[T(au_1 + bu_2) = aT(u_1) + bT(u_2){\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>For example, the term <span class="math">\(T(u) = (\sin^2 t)u'(t)\)</span> is linear because</p>
<div class="math">
\[T(au_1 + bu_2) = (\sin^2 t)(au_1(t) + b u_2(t)) =
a(\sin^2 t)u_1(t) + b(\sin^2 t)u_2(t)  =aT(u_1) + bT(u_2){\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>However, <span class="math">\(T(u)=\sin u\)</span> is nonlinear because</p>

<p>This is a nonlinear differential equation which will be solved by
different strategies in the following.
A time discretization of <a href="#equation-nonlin:timediscrete:logistic:eq">(1)</a>
will either lead to a linear algebraic equation or a nonlinear
algebraic equation at each time level.
In the former case, the time discretization method transforms
the nonlinear ODE into linear subproblems at each time level, and
the solution is straightforward to find since linear algebraic equations
are easy to solve by hand. However,
when the time discretization leads to nonlinear algebraic equations, we
cannot (except in very rare cases) solve these without turning to
approximate, iterative solution methods.</p>
<p>The following subsections first introduce various methods
using <a href="#equation-nonlin:timediscrete:logistic:eq">(1)</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>explicit time discretization methods (with no need to

<p>Thereafter, we compare the performance of the various approaches. Despite

reveal typical features of the various methods in much more complicated
nonlinear PDE problems.</p>

The nonlinearity in the original equation poses in this case no difficulty

Any other explicit scheme in time will also give only linear

<div class="math">

<p>We shall now introduce a shorter and often cleaner notation for
nonlinear algebraic equations at a given time level. The notation is
inspired by the natural notation, i.e., variable names, used in a
program, especially in more advanced partial differential equation
problems. The unknown in the algebraic equation is denoted by <span class="math">\(u\)</span>,
while <span class="math">\(u^{(1)}\)</span> is the value of the unknown at the previous time level
(in general <span class="math">\(u^{(\ell)}\)</span> is the value of the unknown <span class="math">\(\ell\)</span> levels
back in time). The notation will be frequently used in later
sections. What is meant by <span class="math">\(u\)</span> (the exact solution of the PDE problem,
the numerical approximation to the exact solution, or the unknown
solution at a certain time level) should be evident from the context.</p>
<p>The quadratic equation for the unknown <span class="math">\(u^n\)</span> in
<a href="#equation-nonlin:timediscrete:logistic:eq:BE">(2)</a> can with the new
notation be written</p>

<p>Now we encounter a fundamental challenge with nonlinear
algebraic equations:
the equation may have more than one solution. How do we pick the right
solution? In the present simple case we can expand the square root
in a series in <span class="math">\(\Delta t\)</span> and truncate after the linear term since
the Backward Euler scheme will introduce an error proportional to

<h2>Linearization<a class="headerlink" href="#linearization" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When the time integration of an ODE results in a nonlinear algebraic
equation, we must normally find its solution by defining a sequence
of linear equations and hope that the solutions of these linear equations
converge to the desired solution of the nonlinear algebraic equation.
Usually this means solving the linear equation repeatedly in an
iterative fashion.
Alternatively, the nonlinear equation can sometimes be approximated by one
linear equation, and consequently there is no need for iteration.</p>
<p id="index-1">Constructing a linear equation from a nonlinear one requires
<em>linearization</em> of each nonlinear term. This can be done manually
as in Picard iteration, or fully algorithmically as in Newton&#8217;s method.
Examples will best illustrate how to linearize nonlinear problems.</p>

<p>with <span class="math">\(a=\Delta t\)</span>, <span class="math">\(b=1-\Delta t\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(c=-u^{(1)}\)</span>.
Let <span class="math">\(u^{-}\)</span> be an available approximation of the unknown <span class="math">\(u\)</span>.
Then we can linearize the term <span class="math">\(u^2\)</span> simply by writing
<span class="math">\(u^{-}u\)</span>. The resulting equation, <span class="math">\(\hat F(u)=0\)</span>, is now linear
and hence easy to solve:</p>
<div class="math">
\[F(u)\approx\hat F(u) = au^{-}u + bu + c = 0{\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>Since the equation <span class="math">\(\hat F=0\)</span> is only approximate, the solution <span class="math">\(u\)</span>
does not equal the exact solution <span class="math">\({u_{\small\mbox{e}}}\)</span> of the exact
equation <span class="math">\(F({u_{\small\mbox{e}}})=0\)</span>, but we can hope that <span class="math">\(u\)</span> is closer to
<span class="math">\({u_{\small\mbox{e}}}\)</span> than <span class="math">\(u^{-}\)</span> is, and hence it makes sense to repeat the
procedure, i.e., set <span class="math">\(u^{-}=u\)</span> and solve <span class="math">\(\hat F(u)=0\)</span> again.</p>
<p>The idea of turning a nonlinear equation into a linear one by
using an approximation <span class="math">\(u^{-}\)</span> of <span class="math">\(u\)</span> in nonlinear terms is
a widely used approach that goes under many names:
<em>fixed-point iteration</em>, the method of <em>successive substitutions</em>,
<em>nonlinear Richardson iteration</em>, and <em>Picard iteration</em>.
We will stick to the latter name.</p>
<p>Picard iteration for solving the nonlinear equation
arising from the Backward Euler discretization of the logistic
equation can be written as</p>
<div class="math">
\[u = -\frac{c}{au^{-} + b},\quad u^{-}\ \leftarrow\ u{\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>The iteration is started with the value of the unknown at the
previous time level: <span class="math">\(u^{-}=u^{(1)}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Some prefer an explicit iteration counter as superscript
in the mathematical notation. Let <span class="math">\(u^k\)</span> be the computed approximation
to the solution in iteration <span class="math">\(k\)</span>. In iteration <span class="math">\(k+1\)</span> we want
to solve</p>
<div class="math">
\[au^k u^{k+1} + bu^{k+1} + c = 0\quad\Rightarrow\quad u^{k+1}
= -\frac{c}{au^k + b},\quad k=0,1,\ldots\]</div>
<p>Since we need to perform the iteration at every time level, the
time level counter is often also included:</p>
<div class="math">
\[au^{n,k} u^{n,k+1} + bu^{n,k+1} - u^{n-1} = 0\quad\Rightarrow\quad u^{n,k+1}
= \frac{u^n}{au^{n,k} + b},\quad k=0,1,\ldots,\]</div>
<p>with the start value <span class="math">\(u^{n,0}=u^{n-1}\)</span> and the final converged value
<span class="math">\(u^{n}=u^{n,k}\)</span> for sufficiently large <span class="math">\(k\)</span>.</p>
<p>However, we will normally apply a mathematical notation in our
final formulas that is as close as possible to what we aim to write
in a computer code and then it becomes natural to use <span class="math">\(u\)</span> and <span class="math">\(u^{-}\)</span>
instead of <span class="math">\(u^{k+1}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(u^k\)</span> or <span class="math">\(u^{n,k+1}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(u^{n,k}\)</span>.</p>

<span id="index-9"></span><h3>A single Picard iteration<a class="headerlink" href="#a-single-picard-iteration" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Instead of iterating until a stopping criterion is fulfilled, one may
iterate a specific number of times. Just one Picard iteration is
popular as this corresponds to the intuitive idea of approximating
a nonlinear term like <span class="math">\((u^n)^2\)</span> by <span class="math">\(u^{n-1}u^n\)</span>. This follows
from the linearization <span class="math">\(u^{-}u^n\)</span> and the initial choice of
<span class="math">\(u^{-}=u^{n-1}\)</span> at time level <span class="math">\(t_n\)</span>. In other words, a single
Picard iteration corresponds to using the solution at
the previous time level to linearize
nonlinear terms. The resulting discretization
becomes</p>

<p>which is a linear algebraic equation in the unknown <span class="math">\(u^n\)</span>, and
therefore we can easily solve for <span class="math">\(u^n\)</span>, and there is no need
for any alternative notation.</p>
<p>We shall later refer to the strategy of taking one Picard step, or
equivalently, linearizing terms with use of the solution at the
previous time step, as the <em>Picard1</em> method. It is a widely used
approach in science and technology, but with some limitations if

<p>The term <span class="math">\(u^{n+\frac{1}{2}}\)</span> is normally approximated by an arithmetic
mean,</p>
<div class="math">
\[u^{n+\frac{1}{2}}\approx \frac{1}{2}(u^n + u^{n+1}),\]</div>
<p>such that the scheme involves the unknown function only at the time levels
where we actually compute it.
The same arithmetic mean applied to the nonlinear term gives</p>
<div class="math">
\[(u^{n+\frac{1}{2}})^2\approx \frac{1}{4}(u^n + u^{n+1})^2,\]</div>
<p>which is nonlinear in the unknown <span class="math">\(u^{n+1}\)</span>.
However, using a <em>geometric mean</em> for <span class="math">\((u^{n+\frac{1}{2}})^2\)</span>
is a way of linearizing the nonlinear term in
<a href="#equation-nonlin:timediscrete:logistic:geometric:mean:scheme">(6)</a>:</p>
<div class="math">
\[(u^{n+\frac{1}{2}})^2\approx u^nu^{n+1}{\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>Using an arithmetic mean on the linear <span class="math">\(u^{n+\frac{1}{2}}\)</span> term in
<a href="#equation-nonlin:timediscrete:logistic:geometric:mean:scheme">(6)</a> and a geometric
mean for the second term, results in a linearized equation for the
unknown <span class="math">\(u^{n+1}\)</span>:</p>
<div class="math">
\[\frac{u^{n+1}-u^n}{\Delta t} =
\frac{1}{2}(u^n + u^{n+1}) + u^nu^{n+1},\]</div>
<p>which can readily be solved:</p>
<div class="math">
\[u^{n+1} = \frac{1 + \frac{1}{2}\Delta t}{1+\Delta t u^n - \frac{1}{2}\Delta t}
u^n{\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>This scheme can be coded directly, and since
there is no nonlinear algebraic equation to iterate over,
we skip the simplified notation with <span class="math">\(u\)</span> for <span class="math">\(u^{n+1}\)</span>
and <span class="math">\(u^{(1)}\)</span> for <span class="math">\(u^n\)</span>. The technique with using
a geometric average is an example of transforming a nonlinear
algebraic equation to a linear one, without any need for iterations.</p>
<p>The geometric mean approximation is often very effective for
linearizing quadratic nonlinearities. Both the arithmetic and geometric mean
approximations have truncation errors of order <span class="math">\(\Delta t^2\)</span> and are
therefore compatible with the truncation error <span class="math">\({\mathcal{O}(\Delta t^)}\)</span>
of the centered difference approximation for <span class="math">\(u^\prime\)</span> in the Crank-Nicolson
method.</p>
<p>Applying the operator notation for the means and finite differences,
the linearized Crank-Nicolson scheme for the logistic equation can be
compactly expressed as</p>
<div class="math">
\[[D_t u = \overline{u}^{t} + \overline{u^2}^{t,g}]^{n+\frac{1}{2}}{\thinspace .}\]</div>
<div class="admonition-remark admonition">
<p class="first admonition-title">Remark</p>
<p class="last">If we use an arithmetic instead of a geometric mean
for the nonlinear term in
<a href="#equation-nonlin:timediscrete:logistic:geometric:mean:scheme">(6)</a>,
we end up with a nonlinear term <span class="math">\((u^{n+1})^2\)</span>.
This term can be linearized as <span class="math">\(u^{-}u^{n+1}\)</span> in a Picard iteration
approach and in particular as
<span class="math">\(u^nu^{n+1}\)</span> in a Picard1 iteration approach.
The latter gives a scheme almost identical to the one arising from
a geometric mean (the difference in <span class="math">\(u^{n+1}\)</span>

<p>The Backward Euler scheme <a href="#equation-nonlin:timediscrete:logistic:eq:BE">(2)</a>
for the logistic equation leads to a nonlinear algebraic equation
<a href="#equation-nonlin:timediscrete:logistic:eq:F">(3)</a>. Now we write any nonlinear
algebraic equation in the general and compact form</p>
<div class="math">
\[F(u) = 0{\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>Newton&#8217;s method linearizes this equation by approximating <span class="math">\(F(u)\)</span> by
its Taylor series expansion around a computed value <span class="math">\(u^{-}\)</span>
and keeping only the linear part:</p>
<div class="math">
\[\begin{split}F(u) &amp;= F(u^{-}) + F^{\prime}(u^{-})(u - u^{-}) + {\frac{1}{2}}F^{\prime\prime}(u^{-})(u-u^{-})^2

&amp; \approx F(u^{-}) + F^{\prime}(u^{-})(u - u^{-}) = \hat F(u){\thinspace .}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>The linear equation <span class="math">\(\hat F(u)=0\)</span> has the solution</p>
<div class="math">
\[u = u^{-} - \frac{F(u^{-})}{F^{\prime}(u^{-})}{\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>Expressed with an iteration index in the unknown, Newton&#8217;s method takes
on the more familiar mathematical form</p>
<div class="math">
\[u^{k+1} = u^k - \frac{F(u^k)}{F^{\prime}(u^k)},\quad k=0,1,\ldots\]</div>
<p>It can be shown that the error in iteration <span class="math">\(k+1\)</span> of Newton&#8217;s method is
the square of the error in iteration <span class="math">\(k\)</span>, a result referred to as
<em>quadratic convergence</em>. This means that for
small errors the method converges very fast, and in particular much
faster than Picard iteration and other iteration methods.
(The proof of this result is found in most textbooks on numerical analysis.)
However, the quadratic convergence appears only if <span class="math">\(u^k\)</span> is sufficiently
close to the solution. Further away from the solution the method can
easily converge very slowly or diverge. The reader is encouraged to do

<p>We may run experiments with the model problem
<a href="#equation-nonlin:timediscrete:logistic:eq">(1)</a> and the different strategies for
dealing with nonlinearities as described above. For a quite coarse
time resolution, <span class="math">\(\Delta t=0.9\)</span>, use of a tolerance <span class="math">\(\epsilon_r=0.1\)</span>
in the stopping criterion introduces an iteration error, especially in
the Picard iterations, that is visibly much larger than the
time discretization error due to a large <span class="math">\(\Delta t\)</span>. This is illustrated
by comparing the upper two plots in
Figure <a class="reference internal" href="#nonlin-timediscrete-logistic-impl-fig-u"><em>The impact of solution strategies and for four different time step lengths on the solution</em></a>. The one to
the right has a stricter tolerance <span class="math">\(\epsilon = 10^{-3}\)</span>, which leads
to all the curves corresponding to Picard and Newton iteration to be
on top of each other (and no changes can be visually observed by
reducing <span class="math">\(\epsilon_r\)</span> further). The reason why Newton&#8217;s method does
much better than Picard iteration in the upper left plot is that
Newton&#8217;s method with one step comes far below the <span class="math">\(\epsilon_r\)</span> tolerance,
while the Picard iteration needs on average 7 iterations to bring the
residual down to <span class="math">\(\epsilon_r=10^{-1}\)</span>, which gives insufficient
accuracy in the solution of the nonlinear equation. It is obvious
that the Picard1 method gives significant errors in addition to
the time discretization unless the time step is as small as in
the lower right plot.</p>
<p>The <em>BE exact</em> curve corresponds to using the exact solution of the
quadratic equation at each time level, so this curve is only affected
by the Backward Euler time discretization.  The <em>CN gm</em> curve
corresponds to the theoretically more accurate Crank-Nicolson
discretization, combined with a geometric mean for linearization.
This curve appear as more accurate, especially if we take the plot in
the lower right with a small <span class="math">\(\Delta t\)</span> and an appropriately small
<span class="math">\(\epsilon_r\)</span> value as the exact curve.</p>
<p>When it comes to the need for iterations, Figure
<a class="reference internal" href="#nonlin-timediscrete-logistic-impl-fig-iter"><em>Comparison of the number of iterations at various time levels for Picard and Newton iteration</em></a> displays the number of
iterations required at each time level for Newton&#8217;s method and
Picard iteration. The smaller <span class="math">\(\Delta t\)</span> is, the better starting value
we have for the iteration, and the faster the convergence is.
With <span class="math">\(\Delta t = 0.9\)</span> Picard iteration requires on average 32 iterations
per time step, but this number is dramatically reduced as <span class="math">\(\Delta t\)</span>
is reduced.</p>
<p>However, introducing relaxation and a parameter <span class="math">\(\omega=0.8\)</span>
immediately reduces the average of 32 to 7, indicating that for the large
<span class="math">\(\Delta t=0.9\)</span>, Picard iteration takes too long steps. An approximately optimal
value for <span class="math">\(\omega\)</span> in this case is 0.5, which results in an average of only
2 iterations! Even more dramatic impact of <span class="math">\(\omega\)</span> appears when
<span class="math">\(\Delta t = 1\)</span>: Picard iteration does not convergence in 1000 iterations,
but <span class="math">\(\omega=0.5\)</span> again brings the average number of iterations down to 2.</p>

<p><strong>Remark.</strong>
The simple Crank-Nicolson method with a geometric mean for the quadratic
nonlinearity gives visually more accurate solutions than the
Backward Euler discretization. Even with a tolerance of <span class="math">\(\epsilon_r=10^{-3}\)</span>,
all the methods for treating the nonlinearities in the Backward Euler
discretization gives graphs that cannot be distinguished. So for
accuracy in this problem, the time discretization is much more crucial
than <span class="math">\(\epsilon_r\)</span>. Ideally, one should estimate the error in the
time discretization, as the solution progresses, and set <span class="math">\(\epsilon_r\)</span>
accordingly.</p>

<p>Approximating <span class="math">\(u^{\prime}\)</span> by a backward difference leads to a Backward Euler

<div class="math">
\[F(u^n) = u^{n} - \Delta t\, f(u^n, t_n) - u^{n-1}=0,\]</div>

<p>A simple Picard iteration, not knowing anything about the nonlinear

<div class="math">
\[\hat F(u) = u - \Delta t\, f(u^{-},t_n) - u^{(1)}{\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>The iteration starts with <span class="math">\(u^{-}=u^{(1)}\)</span> and proceeds with repeating</p>
<div class="math">
\[u^* = \Delta t\, f(u^{-},t_n) + u^{(1)},\quad u = \omega u^* + (1-\omega)u^{-},

<p>until a stopping criterion is fulfilled.</p>
<div class="admonition-explicit-vs-implicit-treatment-of-nonlinear-terms admonition">
<p class="first admonition-title">Explicit vs implicit treatment of nonlinear terms</p>
<p>Evaluating <span class="math">\(f\)</span> for a known <span class="math">\(u^{-}\)</span> is referred to as <em>explicit</em> treatment of
<span class="math">\(f\)</span>, while if <span class="math">\(f(u,t)\)</span> has some structure, say <span class="math">\(f(u,t) = u^3\)</span>, parts of
<span class="math">\(f\)</span> can involve the known <span class="math">\(u\)</span>, as in the manual linearization
like <span class="math">\((u^{-})^2u\)</span>, and then the treatment of <span class="math">\(f\)</span> is &#8220;more implicit&#8221;
and &#8220;less explicit&#8221;. This terminology is inspired by time discretization
of <span class="math">\(u^{\prime}=f(u,t)\)</span>, where evaluating <span class="math">\(f\)</span> for known <span class="math">\(u\)</span> values gives
explicit schemes, while treating <span class="math">\(f\)</span> or parts of <span class="math">\(f\)</span> implicitly,
makes <span class="math">\(f\)</span> contribute to the unknown terms in the equation at the new
time level.</p>
<p>Explicit treatment of <span class="math">\(f\)</span> usually means stricter conditions on
<span class="math">\(\Delta t\)</span> for stability of time discretization schemes. The same goes
for iterations techniques for nonlinear algebraic equations: the more
<span class="math">\(f\)</span> can involve unknowns to be solved for, the faster the convergence
may be.</p>
<p>We may say that <span class="math">\(f(u,t)=u^3\)</span> is treated explicitly if we evaluate <span class="math">\(f\)</span>
as <span class="math">\((u^{-})^3\)</span>, partially implicit if we linearize as <span class="math">\((u^{-})^2u\)</span>
and fully implicit if we represent <span class="math">\(f\)</span> by <span class="math">\(u^3\)</span>. (Of course, the
fully implicit representation will require further linearization,
but with <span class="math">\(f(u,t)=u^2\)</span> a fully implicit treatment is possible if
the resulting quadratic equation is solved with a formula.)</p>
<p>For the ODE <span class="math">\(u^{\prime}=-u^3\)</span> with <span class="math">\(f(u,t)=-u^3\)</span> and coarse
time resolution <span class="math">\(\Delta t = 0.4\)</span>, Picard iteration with <span class="math">\((u^{-})^2u\)</span>
requires 8 iterations with <span class="math">\(\epsilon_r = 10^{-3}\)</span> for the first
time step, while <span class="math">\((u^{-})^3\)</span> leads to 22 iterations. After about 10
time steps both approaches are down to about 2 iterations per time
step, but this example shows a potential of treating <span class="math">\(f\)</span> more
implicitly.</p>
<p class="last">A trick to treat <span class="math">\(f\)</span> implicitly in Picard iteration is to
evaluate it as <span class="math">\(f(u^{-},t)u/u^{-}\)</span>. For a polynomial <span class="math">\(f\)</span>, <span class="math">\(f(u,t)=u^m\)</span>,
this corresponds to <span class="math">\((u^{-})^{m-1}u\)</span>. Sometimes this more implicit
treatment has no effect, as with <span class="math">\(f(u,t)=exp(-u)\)</span> and <span class="math">\(f(u,t)=\ln (1+u)\)</span>,
but with <span class="math">\(f(u,t)=sin(2(u+1))\)</span>, the <span class="math">\(f(u^{-},t)u/u^{-}\)</span> trick
leads to 7, 9, and 11 iterations during the first three steps, while
<span class="math">\(f(u^{-},t)\)</span> demands 17, 21, and 20 iterations.
