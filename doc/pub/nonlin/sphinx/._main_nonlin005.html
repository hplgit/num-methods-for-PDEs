<p>The fundamental ideas in the
derivation of <span class="math">\(F_i\)</span> and <span class="math">\(J_{i,j}\)</span> in the 1D model problem
are easily generalized to multi-dimensional problems.
Nevertheless, the expressions involved are slightly different, with
derivatives in <span class="math">\(x\)</span> replaced by <span class="math">\(\nabla\)</span>, so we present some
examples below in detail.</p>
<div class="section" id="finite-element-discretization">

<div class="math">
\[u^n - \Delta t\nabla\cdot({\alpha}(u^n)\nabla u^n) - \Delta t f(u^n) = u^{n-1}{\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>We may alternatively write this equation
with <span class="math">\(u\)</span> for <span class="math">\(u^n\)</span> and <span class="math">\(u^{(1)}\)</span> for <span class="math">\(u^{n-1}\)</span>:</p>
<div class="math">
\[u - \Delta t\nabla\cdot({\alpha}(u)\nabla u) - \Delta t f(u) = u^{(1)}{\thinspace .}\]</div>

<p class="first admonition-title">Understand the meaning of the symbol <span class="math">\(u\)</span> in various formulas</p>
<p>Note that the mathematical meaning of the symbol <span class="math">\(u\)</span> changes in
the above equations: <span class="math">\(u(\boldsymbol{x},t)\)</span> is the exact solution of <a class="reference internal" href="#eq-nonlin-alglevel-dd-fe-pde"><span>(75)</span></a>, <span class="math">\(u^n(\boldsymbol{x})\)</span> is an approximation to the exact solution at <span class="math">\(t=t_n\)</span>,
while <span class="math">\(u(\boldsymbol{x})\)</span> in the latter equation is a synonym for <span class="math">\(u^n\)</span>.
Below, this <span class="math">\(u(\boldsymbol{x})\)</span> will be approximated by a new
<span class="math">\(u=\sum_kc_k{\psi}_k(\boldsymbol{x})\)</span> in space, and then the actual <span class="math">\(u\)</span> symbol used
in the Picard and Newton iterations is a further approximation of
<span class="math">\(\sum_kc_k{\psi}_k\)</span> arising from the nonlinear iteration algorithm.</p>
<p class="last">Much literature reserves <span class="math">\(u\)</span> for the exact solution, uses <span class="math">\(u_h(x, t)\)</span>
for the finite element solution that varies continuously in time,
introduces perhaps <span class="math">\(u_h^n\)</span> as the approximation of <span class="math">\(u_h\)</span> at time <span class="math">\(t_n\)</span>,
arising from some time discretization, and then finally applies
<span class="math">\(u_h^{n,k}\)</span> for the approximation to <span class="math">\(u_h^n\)</span> in the <span class="math">\(k\)</span>-th
iteration of a Picard or Newton method. The converged solution at
the previous time step can be called <span class="math">\(u_h^{n-1}\)</span>, but then this
quantity is an approximate solution of the nonlinear equations (at the
previous time level), while the counterpart <span class="math">\(u_h^n\)</span> is formally the
exact solution of the nonlinear equations at the current time level.
The various symbols in the
mathematics can in this way be clearly distinguished. However,
we favor to use <span class="math">\(u\)</span> for the quantity that is most naturally called <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">u</span></code>
in the code, and that is the most recent approximation to the solution,
e.g., named <span class="math">\(u_h^{n,k}\)</span> above. This is also the key quantity of
interest in mathematical derivations of algorithms as well.
Choosing <span class="math">\(u\)</span> this way makes the most important mathematical cleaner
than using more cluttered notation as <span class="math">\(u_h^{n,k}\)</span>.
We therefore introduce other symbols for other versions of the unknown
function. It is most appropriate for us to say that <span class="math">\({u_{\small\mbox{e}}}(\boldsymbol{x}, t)\)</span> is the
exact solution, <span class="math">\(u^n\)</span> in the equation above
is the approximation to <span class="math">\({u_{\small\mbox{e}}}(\boldsymbol{x},t_n)\)</span> after
time discretization, and <span class="math">\(u\)</span> is the spatial approximation to
<span class="math">\(u^n\)</span> from the most recent iteration in a nonlinear iteration method.</p>
</div>
<p>Let us assume homogeneous Neumann conditions
on the entire boundary for simplicity in the boundary term. The
variational form becomes: find <span class="math">\(u\in V\)</span> such that</p>
<div class="math" id="eq-nonlin-alglevel-dd-fe-varform">
\[\tag{76}
\int_\Omega (uv + \Delta t\,{\alpha}(u)\nabla u\cdot\nabla v
    - \Delta t f(u)v - u^{(1)} v){\, \mathrm{d}x} = 0,\quad \forall v\in V{\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>The nonlinear algebraic equations follow from setting <span class="math">\(v={\psi}_i\)</span>
and using the representation <span class="math">\(u=\sum_kc_k{\psi}_k\)</span>, which we
just write as</p>
<div class="math" id="eq-nonlin-alglevel-dd-fe-fi">
\[\tag{77}

    - \Delta t f(u){\psi}_i - u^{(1)}{\psi}_i){\, \mathrm{d}x}{\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>Picard iteration needs a linearization where we use
the most recent approximation <span class="math">\(u^{-}\)</span> to <span class="math">\(u\)</span> in
<span class="math">\({\alpha}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(f\)</span>:</p>

<p>The equations <span class="math">\(\hat F_i=0\)</span> are now linear and we can easily derive
a linear system <span class="math">\(\sum_{j\in{\mathcal{I}_s}}A_{i,j}c_j=b_i\)</span>, <span class="math">\(i\in{\mathcal{I}_s}\)</span>,
for the unknown coefficients
<span class="math">\(\left\{ {c}_i \right\}_{i\in{\mathcal{I}_s}}\)</span> by inserting <span class="math">\(u=\sum_jc_j{\psi}_j\)</span>. We get</p>
<div class="math">
\[A_{i,j} =
\int_\Omega ({\varphi}_j{\psi}_i + \Delta t\,{\alpha}(u^{-})\nabla {\varphi}_j

\int_\Omega (\Delta t f(u^{-}){\psi}_i + u^{(1)}{\psi}_i){\, \mathrm{d}x}{\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>In Newton&#8217;s method we need to evaluate <span class="math">\(F_i\)</span> with the known value
<span class="math">\(u^{-}\)</span> for <span class="math">\(u\)</span>:</p>

    - \Delta t f(u^{-}){\psi}_i - u^{(1)}{\psi}_i){\, \mathrm{d}x}{\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>The Jacobian is obtained by differentiating
<a class="reference internal" href="#eq-nonlin-alglevel-dd-fe-fi"><span>(77)</span></a> and using</p>
<div class="math" id="eq-auto33">

<p>The result becomes</p>

system in Newton&#8217;s method applies the known approximation <span class="math">\(u^{-}\)</span>
for <span class="math">\(u\)</span>:</p>

<p>Hopefully, this example also shows how convenient the notation
with <span class="math">\(u\)</span> and <span class="math">\(u^{-}\)</span> is: the unknown to be computed is always <span class="math">\(u\)</span> and
linearization by inserting known (previously computed) values
is a matter of adding an underscore.

<h3>Robin conditions<a class="headerlink" href="#robin-conditions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>

<p>The <span class="math">\(J_{i,j,i,j}\)</span> entry has a few more terms and is left as an
exercise.
Inserting the most recent approximation
<span class="math">\(u^{-}\)</span> for <span class="math">\(u\)</span> in the <span class="math">\(J\)</span> and <span class="math">\(F\)</span> formulas and then
forming <span class="math">\(J\delta u=-F\)</span> gives the linear system to be solved
in each Newton iteration. Boundary conditions will affect the
formulas when any of the indices coincide with a boundary value
of an index.</p>

<h2>Continuation methods<a class="headerlink" href="#continuation-methods" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p id="index-0">Picard iteration or Newton&#8217;s method may diverge when solving PDEs with
severe nonlinearities. Relaxation with <span class="math">\(\omega &lt;1\)</span>
may help, but in highly nonlinear problems it can be
necessary to introduce a <em>continuation parameter</em> <span class="math">\(\Lambda\)</span> in
the problem: <span class="math">\(\Lambda =0\)</span> gives a version of the
problem that is easy to solve, while
<span class="math">\(\Lambda =1\)</span> is the target problem. The idea is then
to increase <span class="math">\(\Lambda\)</span> in steps, <span class="math">\(\Lambda_0=0 ,\Lambda_1 &lt;\cdots &lt;\Lambda_n=1\)</span>,
and use the solution from the problem with <span class="math">\(\Lambda_{i-1}\)</span> as
initial guess for the iterations in the problem corresponding
to <span class="math">\(\Lambda_i\)</span>.</p>
<p>The continuation method is easiest to understand through an example.
Suppose we intend to solve</p>
<div class="math">
\[-\nabla\cdot\left( ||\nabla u||^q\nabla u\right) = f,\]</div>
<p>which is an equation modeling the flow of a non-Newtonian fluid through
a channel or pipe. For <span class="math">\(q=0\)</span> we have the Poisson equation (corresponding
to a Newtonian fluid) and the problem is linear. A typical
value for pseudo-plastic fluids may be <span class="math">\(q_n=-0.8\)</span>. We can introduce
the continuation parameter <span class="math">\(\Lambda\in [0,1]\)</span> such that
<span class="math">\(q=q_n\Lambda\)</span>. Let <span class="math">\(\{\Lambda_\ell\}_{\ell=0}^n\)</span> be the sequence of
<span class="math">\(\Lambda\)</span> values in <span class="math">\([0,1]\)</span>, with corresponding <span class="math">\(q\)</span> values
<span class="math">\(\{q_\ell\}_{\ell=0}^n\)</span>. We can then solve a sequence of problems</p>
<div class="math">
\[-\nabla\cdot\left( ||\nabla u^\ell||^q_\ell\nabla u^\ell\right) = f,\quad
\ell = 0,\ldots,n,\]</div>
<p>where the initial guess for iterating on <span class="math">\(u^{\ell}\)</span> is the
previously computed solution <span class="math">\(u^{\ell-1}\)</span>. If a particular <span class="math">\(\Lambda_\ell\)</span>
leads to convergence problems, one may try a smaller
increase in <span class="math">\(\Lambda\)</span>:
<span class="math">\(\Lambda_* = \frac{1}{2} (\Lambda_{\ell-1}+\Lambda_\ell)\)</span>,
and repeat halving the step in <span class="math">\(\Lambda\)</span> until convergence is reestablished.</p>
