<p>The integrals in nonlinear finite element equations are computed
by numerical integration rules in computer programs, so the
formulas for the variational form are directly transferred to numbers.
It is also of interest to understand the nature of the system of difference equations
that arises from the finite element method in nonlinear problems and
to compare with corresponding expressions arising from finite difference
discretization. We shall dive into this problem here. To see the
structure of the difference equations implied by the finite element method,
we have to find symbolic expressions for the integrals, and this is
extremely difficult since the integrals involve the unknown function
in nonlinear problems. However, there are some techniques that allow
us to approximate the integrals and work out symbolic formulas that
can be compared with their finite difference counterparts.</p>
<p>We shall address the 1D model problem <a class="reference internal" href="._main_nonlin004.html#eq-nonlin-alglevel-1d-pde"><span>(47)</span></a> from
the beginning of the section <a class="reference internal" href="._main_nonlin004.html#nonlin-alglevel-1d"><span>Discretization of 1D stationary nonlinear differential equations</span></a>.
The finite difference discretization is shown in the section <a class="reference internal" href="._main_nonlin004.html#nonlin-alglevel-1d-fd"><span>Finite difference discretization</span></a>, while the variational form based on
Galerkin&#8217;s method is developed in the section <a class="reference internal" href="._main_nonlin004.html#nonlin-alglevel-1d-fe"><span>Galerkin-type discretization</span></a>.
We build directly on formulas developed in the latter section.</p>

<p>Introduction of finite element basis functions <span class="math">\({\varphi}_i\)</span> means setting</p>
<div class="math">
\[{\psi}_i = {\varphi}_{\nu(i)},\quad i\in{\mathcal{I}_s},\]</div>
<p>where degree of freedom number <span class="math">\(\nu(i)\)</span> in the mesh corresponds to
unknown number <span class="math">\(i\)</span> (<span class="math">\(c_i\)</span>).
In the present example, we use all the basis functions except the
last at <span class="math">\(i=N_n-1\)</span>, i.e., <span class="math">\({\mathcal{I}_s} = \{0,\ldots,N_n-2\}\)</span>, and <span class="math">\(\nu(j)=j\)</span>.
The expansion of <span class="math">\(u\)</span> can be taken as</p>
<div class="math">
\[u = D + \sum_{j\in{\mathcal{I}_s}} c_j{\varphi}_{\nu(j)},\]</div>
<p>but it is more common in a finite element context to use a boundary
function <span class="math">\(B=\sum_{j\in{I_b}}U_j{\varphi}_j\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(U_j\)</span> is prescribed
Dirichlet condition for degree of freedom number <span class="math">\(j\)</span> and <span class="math">\(U_j\)</span> is
the corresponding value.</p>
<div class="math">
\[u = D{\varphi}_{N_n-1} + \sum_{j\in{\mathcal{I}_s}} c_j{\varphi}_{\nu(j)}{\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>In the general case with <span class="math">\(u\)</span> prescribed as <span class="math">\(U_j\)</span> at some nodes <span class="math">\(j\in{I_b}\)</span>,
we set</p>

\[u = \sum_{j\in{I_b}} U_j{\varphi}_j +

<h3>Finite element approximation of functions of <span class="math">\(u\)</span><a class="headerlink" href="#finite-element-approximation-of-functions-of" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Since we already expand <span class="math">\(u\)</span> as <span class="math">\(\sum_j{\varphi}_j u(x_{j})\)</span>, we may use the
same approximation for other functions as well. For example,</p>
<div class="math">
\[f(u)\approx \sum_{j} f(x_{j}){\varphi}_j,\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(f(x_{j})\)</span> is the value of <span class="math">\(f\)</span> at node <span class="math">\(j\)</span>. Since <span class="math">\(f\)</span> is a function
of <span class="math">\(u\)</span>, <span class="math">\(f(x_{j})=f(u(x_{j}))\)</span>. Introducing
<span class="math">\(u_j\)</span> as a short form for <span class="math">\(u(x_{j})\)</span>, we can write</p>
<div class="math">
\[f(u)\approx \sum_{j} f(u_{j}){\varphi}_j{\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>This approximation is known as the <em>group finite element method</em>
or the <em>product approximation</em> technique. The index <span class="math">\(j\)</span> runs over
all node numbers in the mesh.</p>
<p>The principal advantages of the group finite element method are two-fold:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Complicated nonlinear expressions can be simplified to increase
the efficiency of numerical computations.</li>
<li>One can derive <em>symbolic forms</em> of the difference equations arising
from the finite element method in nonlinear problems.
The symbolic form is useful for comparing finite element and finite
difference equations of nonlinear differential equation problems.</li>
</ol>
<p>Below, we shall explore point 2 to see exactly how the finite element
method creates more complex expressions in the resulting
linear system (the difference equations) that the finite difference
method does. It turns out that it is very difficult to see
what kind of terms in the difference equations that arise from
<span class="math">\(\int f(u){\varphi}_i{\, \mathrm{d}x}\)</span> without using the group finite element
method or numerical integration utilizing the nodes only.</p>
<p>Note, however, that an expression like <span class="math">\(\int f(u){\varphi}_i{\, \mathrm{d}x}\)</span> causes
no problems in a computer program as the integral is calculated by
numerical integration using an existing approximation of <span class="math">\(u\)</span> in
<span class="math">\(f(u)\)</span> such that the integrand can be sampled at any spatial point.</p>

<h3>Simplified problem<a class="headerlink" href="#simplified-problem" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Our aim now is to derive symbolic expressions for the difference
equations arising from the finite element method in nonlinear
problems and compare the expressions with those arising in the
finite difference method. To this end,
let us simplify the model problem and set <span class="math">\(a=0\)</span>, <span class="math">\({\alpha}=1\)</span>,
<span class="math">\(f(u)=u^2\)</span>, and have Neumann conditions at both ends such that we
get a very simple nonlinear problem <span class="math">\(-u^{\prime\prime}=u^2\)</span>,
<span class="math">\(u'(0)=1\)</span>, <span class="math">\(u'(L)=0\)</span>.
The variational form is then</p>
<div class="math">
\[\int_0^L u^{\prime}v^{\prime}{\, \mathrm{d}x} = \int_0^L u^2v{\, \mathrm{d}x}
- v(0),\quad\forall v\in V{\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>The term with <span class="math">\(u^{\prime}v^{\prime}\)</span> is well known so the only new feature is
the term <span class="math">\(\int u^2v{\, \mathrm{d}x}\)</span>.</p>
<p>To make the distance from finite element equations to finite
difference equations as short as possible, we shall substitute <span class="math">\(c_j\)</span>
in the sum <span class="math">\(u=\sum_jc_j{\varphi}_j\)</span> by <span class="math">\(u_j=u(x_{j})\)</span> since <span class="math">\(c_j\)</span> is
the value of <span class="math">\(u\)</span> at node <span class="math">\(j\)</span>. (In the more general case
with Dirichlet conditions as well, we have a sum
<span class="math">\(\sum_jc_j{\varphi}_{\nu(j)}\)</span> where <span class="math">\(c_j\)</span> is replaced by <span class="math">\(u(x_{\nu(j)})\)</span>).
We can then introduce some other counter <span class="math">\(k\)</span> such that it is
meaningful to write <span class="math">\(u=\sum_k u_k{\varphi}_k\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(k\)</span> runs over appropriate
node numbers.)
The quantity <span class="math">\(u_j\)</span> in <span class="math">\(\sum_ju_j{\varphi}_j\)</span>
is the same as <span class="math">\(u\)</span> at mesh point number <span class="math">\(j\)</span>
in the finite difference method, which is commonly denoted <span class="math">\(u_j\)</span>.</p>

<span id="index-1"></span><h3>Application of the group finite element method<a class="headerlink" href="#application-of-the-group-finite-element-method" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Let use the group finite element method to derive the terms in
the difference equation corresponding to <span class="math">\(f(u)\)</span> in the differential
equation. We have</p>
<div class="math">
\[\int_0^L f(u){\varphi}_i{\, \mathrm{d}x} \approx
\int_0^L (\sum_j {\varphi}_jf(u_j)){\varphi}_i{\, \mathrm{d}x}
= \sum_j \left(\int_0^L {\varphi}_i{\varphi}_j{\, \mathrm{d}x}\right) f(u_j){\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>We recognize this expression as the mass matrix <span class="math">\(M\)</span>, arising from
<span class="math">\(\int{\varphi}_i{\varphi}_j{\, \mathrm{d}x}\)</span>, times the
vector <span class="math">\(f=(f(u_0),f(u_1),\ldots,)\)</span>: <span class="math">\(Mf\)</span>. The associated terms
in the difference equations are, for P1 elements,</p>
<div class="math">
\[\frac{h}{6}(f(u_{i-1}) + 4f(u_i) + f(u_{i+1})){\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>Occasionally, we want to interpret this expression in terms of finite
differences, and to this end a rewrite of this expression is convenient:</p>
<div class="math">
\[\frac{h}{6}(f(u_{i-1}) + 4f(u_i) + f(u_{i+1}))
= h[f(u) - \frac{h^2}{6}D_xD_x f(u)]_i{\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>That is, the finite element treatment of <span class="math">\(f(u)\)</span> (when using a group
finite element method) gives the same term as in a finite difference
approach, <span class="math">\(f(u_i)\)</span>, minus a diffusion term which is the
2nd-order discretization of <span class="math">\(\frac{1}{6}h^2f''(x_i)\)</span>.</p>
<p>We may lump the mass matrix through integration with the Trapezoidal
rule so that <span class="math">\(M\)</span> becomes diagonal in the finite element method.
In that case the <span class="math">\(f(u)\)</span> term in the differential equation
gives rise to a single term <span class="math">\(hf(u_i)\)</span>, just as in the finite difference
method.</p>

<p>Let us reconsider a term <span class="math">\(\int f(u)v{\, \mathrm{d}x}\)</span> as treated in the previous
section, but now we want to integrate this term numerically.
Such an approach can lead to easy-to-interpret formulas if we apply
a numerical integration rule that samples the integrand at the node
points <span class="math">\(x_{i}\)</span> only, because at such points, <span class="math">\({\varphi}_j(x_{i})=0\)</span>
if <span class="math">\(j\neq i\)</span>, which leads to great simplifications.</p>
<p>The term in question takes the form</p>
<div class="math">
\[\int_0^L f(\sum_k u_k{\varphi}_k){\varphi}_i{\, \mathrm{d}x}{\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>Evaluation of the integrand at a node <span class="math">\(x_{\ell}\)</span> leads to a
collapse of the sum <span class="math">\(\sum_k u_k{\varphi}_k\)</span> to one term because</p>
<div class="math">
\[\sum_k u_k{\varphi}_k(x_{\ell}) = u_\ell{\thinspace .}\]</div>
<div class="math">
\[f(\sum_k u_k\underbrace{{\varphi}_k(x_{\ell})}_{\delta_{k\ell}})
\underbrace{{\varphi}_i(x_{\ell})}_{\delta_{i\ell}}
= f(u_\ell)\delta_{i\ell},\]</div>
<p>where we have used the Kronecker delta: <span class="math">\(\delta_{ij}=0\)</span> if <span class="math">\(i\neq j\)</span> and
<span class="math">\(\delta_{ij}=1\)</span> if <span class="math">\(i=j\)</span>.</p>
<p>Considering the Trapezoidal rule for integration, where the integration
points are the nodes, we have</p>
<div class="math">
\[\int_0^L f(\sum_k u_k{\varphi}_k(x)){\varphi}_i(x){\, \mathrm{d}x}
\approx h\sum_{\ell=0}^{N_n-1} f(u_\ell)\delta_{i\ell} - \mathcal{C}
= hf(u_i){\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>This is the same representation of the <span class="math">\(f\)</span> term as in the finite
difference method.
The term <span class="math">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span> contains the evaluations of the integrand
at the ends with weight <span class="math">\(\frac{1}{2}\)</span>, needed to make a true Trapezoidal rule:</p>
<div class="math">
\[\mathcal{C} = \frac{h}{2}f(u_0){\varphi}_i(0) + \frac{h}{2}f(u_{N_n-1}){\varphi}_i(L){\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>The answer <span class="math">\(hf(u_i)\)</span> must therefore be multiplied by <span class="math">\(\frac{1}{2}\)</span> if
<span class="math">\(i=0\)</span> or <span class="math">\(i=N_n-1\)</span>. Note that <span class="math">\(\mathcal{C}=0\)</span> for <span class="math">\(i=1,\ldots,N_n-2\)</span>.</p>
<p>One can alternatively use the Trapezoidal rule on the reference cell and
assemble the contributions. It is a bit more labor in this context,
but working on the reference cell is safer as that approach is
guaranteed to handle discontinuous derivatives of finite element
functions correctly (not important in this particular example),
while the rule above was derived with the
assumption that <span class="math">\(f\)</span> is continuous at the integration points.</p>
<p>The conclusion is that it suffices to use the Trapezoidal rule if
one wants to derive the difference equations in the finite element
method and make them similar to those arising in the finite difference
method. The Trapezoidal rule has sufficient accuracy for P1 elements, but
for P2 elements one should turn to Simpson&#8217;s rule.</p>

this term.
To be able to derive symbolic expressions, we must either turn to
the group finite element method or numerical integration in the

<h3>Numerical integration at the nodes<a class="headerlink" href="#numerical-integration-at-the-nodes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Instead of using the group finite element method and exact integration
we can turn to the Trapezoidal rule for computing
<span class="math">\(\int_0^L {\alpha}(\sum_k u_k{\varphi}_k){\varphi}_i^{\prime}{\varphi}_j^{\prime}{\, \mathrm{d}x}\)</span>, again at
the cell level since that is most convenient when we deal with discontinuous
functions <span class="math">\({\varphi}_i'\)</span>:</p>
<div class="math">
\[\int_{-1}^1 \alpha(\sum_t\tilde u_t{\tilde{\varphi}}_t){\tilde{\varphi}}_r'{\tilde{\varphi}}_s'\frac{h}{2}dX
= \int_{-1}^1 {\alpha}(\sum_{t=0}^1
\tilde u_t{\tilde{\varphi}}_t)\frac{2}{h}\frac{d{\tilde{\varphi}}_r}{dX}
\frac{2}{h}\frac{d{\tilde{\varphi}}_s}{dX}\frac{h}{2}dX\nonumber\]</div>
<div class="math">
\[ = \frac{1}{2h}(-1)^r(-1)^s \int_{-1}^1 {\alpha}(\sum_{t=0}^1 u_t{\tilde{\varphi}}_t(X))dX
\nonumber\]</div>
<div class="math">
\[ \approx \frac{1}{2h}(-1)^r(-1)^s{\alpha} (
\sum_{t=0}^1{\tilde{\varphi}}_t(-1)\tilde u_t) + {\alpha}(\sum_{t=0}^1{\tilde{\varphi}}_t(1)\tilde u_t)
\nonumber\]</div>
<div class="math" id="eq-nonlin-alglevel-1d-fe-laplace-ae-trapez">
\[\tag{98}

<p>The element matrix in <a class="reference internal" href="#eq-nonlin-alglevel-1d-fe-laplace-ae-trapez"><span>(98)</span></a>
is identical to the one in
<a class="reference internal" href="#eq-nonlin-alglevel-1d-fe-laplace-ae"><span>(96)</span></a>, showing that the
group finite element method and Trapezoidal integration are
equivalent with a standard finite discretization of a
nonlinear Laplace term <span class="math">\(({\alpha}(u)u^{\prime})^{\prime}\)</span> using an arithmetic mean for
<span class="math">\({\alpha}\)</span>: <span class="math">\([D_x\overline{x}D_xu]_i\)</span>.</p>

<p class="first admonition-title">Remark about integration in the physical <span class="math">\(x\)</span> coordinate</p>
<p class="last">We might comment on integration in the physical coordinate system too.
The common Trapezoidal rule in the section <a class="reference internal" href="#nonlin-alglevel-1d-fe-f"><span>Numerical integration of nonlinear terms by hand</span></a>
cannot be used to integrate derivatives like <span class="math">\({\varphi}_i^{\prime}\)</span>, because
the formula is derived under the assumption of a continuous integrand.
One must instead use the more basic version of the Trapezoidal rule
where all the trapezoids are summed up. This is straightforward, but
I think it is even more straightforward to apply the Trapezoidal
rule on the reference cell and assemble the contributions.</p>
</div>
<p>The term <span class="math">\(\int auv{\, \mathrm{d}x}\)</span> in the variational form is linear and gives
these terms in the algebraic equations:</p>
<div class="math">
\[\frac{ah}{6}(u_{i-1} + 4u_i + u_{i+1})
= ah[u - \frac{h^2}{6}D_xD_x u]_i{\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>The final term in the variational form is the Neumann condition
at the boundary: <span class="math">\(Cv(0)=C{\varphi}_i(0)\)</span>. With a left-to-right numbering
only <span class="math">\(i=0\)</span> will give a contribution <span class="math">\(Cv(0)=C\delta_{i0}\)</span> (since
<span class="math">\({\varphi}_i(0)\neq 0\)</span> only for <span class="math">\(i=0\)</span>).</p>

<p>As we now have explicit expressions for the nonlinear difference
equations also in the finite element method, a Picard or Newton method
can be defined as shown for the finite difference method.  However,
our effort in deriving symbolic forms of the difference equations in
the finite element method was motivated by a desire to see how
nonlinear terms in differential equations make the finite element and
difference method different. For practical calculations in computer
programs we apply numerical integration, normally the more accurate
Gauss-Legendre quadrature rules, to the integrals directly. This
allows us to easily <em>evaluate</em> the nonlinear algebraic equations for a
given numerical approximation of <span class="math">\(u\)</span> (here denoted <span class="math">\(u^{-}\)</span>).  To
<em>solve</em> the nonlinear algebraic equations we need to apply the Picard
iteration method or Newton&#8217;s method to the variational form directly,
as shown next.</p>
