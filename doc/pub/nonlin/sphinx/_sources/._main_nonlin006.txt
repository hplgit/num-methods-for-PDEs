Problem 4: Linearize a nonlinear vibration ODE
----------------------------------------------

Consider a nonlinear vibration problem

.. math::
        
        mu^{\prime\prime} + bu^{\prime}|u^{\prime}| + s(u) = F(t),
        

where :math:`m>0` is a constant, :math:`b\geq 0` is a constant, :math:`s(u)` a possibly
nonlinear function of :math:`u`, and :math:`F(t)` is a prescribed function. Such
models arise from Newton's second law of motion in mechanical
vibration problems where :math:`s(u)` is a spring or restoring force,
:math:`mu^{\prime\prime}` is mass times acceleration, and
:math:`bu^{\prime}|u^{\prime}|` models water or air drag.

Rewrite the equation for :math:`u` as a system of two first-order ODEs, and
discretize this system by a Crank-Nicolson (centered difference)
method. With :math:`v=u^\prime`, we get a nonlinear term
:math:`v^{n+\frac{1}{2}}|v^{n+\frac{1}{2}}|`. Use both a geometric and an
arithmetic average for :math:`v^{n+\frac{1}{2}}`. In the latter case,
explain how to apply Newton's method to solve the nonlinear equations

Problem 10: Finite differences for the 1D Bratu problem
-------------------------------------------------------

We address the so-called Bratu problem

.. _Eq:nonlin:exer:1D:fu:discretize:fd:pde:

.. math::
   :label: nonlin:exer:1D:fu:discretize:fd:pde
        
        u^{\prime\prime} + \lambda e^u=0,\quad x\in (0,1),\quad u(0)=u(1)=0,
        
        

where :math:`\lambda` is a given parameter and :math:`u` is a function of :math:`x`.
This is a widely used model problem for studying numerical
methods for nonlinear differential equations.
The problem :eq:`nonlin:exer:1D:fu:discretize:fd:pde` has an
exact solution

.. math::
         u(x) = -2\ln\left(\frac{\cosh((x-\frac{1}{2})\theta/2)}{\cosh(\theta/4)}\right),

where :math:`\theta` solves

.. math::
         \theta = \sqrt{2\lambda}\cosh(\theta/4){\thinspace .}

There are two solutions of :eq:`nonlin:exer:1D:fu:discretize:fd:pde` for
:math:`0<\lambda <\lambda_c` and no solution for :math:`\lambda >\lambda_c`.
For :math:`\lambda = \lambda_c` there is one unique solution. The critical
value :math:`\lambda_c` solves

.. math::
         1 = \sqrt{2\lambda_c}\frac{1}{4}\sinh(\theta(\lambda_c)/4){\thinspace .}

Problem 11: Integrate functions of finite element expansions
------------------------------------------------------------

.. index:: latex.codecogs.com web site

.. index:: online rendering of LaTeX formulas

We shall investigate integrals on the form

.. _Eq:nonlin:exer:fu:fem:int:global:

.. math::
   :label: nonlin:exer:fu:fem:int:global
        
        \int_0^L f(\sum_ku_k{\varphi}_k(x)){\varphi}_i(x){\, \mathrm{d}x},
        
        

where :math:`{\varphi}_i(x)` are P1 finite element basis functions and :math:`u_k`
are unknown coefficients, more precisely the values of the unknown
function :math:`u` at nodes :math:`x_{k}`. We introduce a node numbering that
goes from left to right and also that all cells have
the same length :math:`h`. Given :math:`i`, the integral
only gets contributions from :math:`[x_{i-1},x_{i+1}]`. On this
interval :math:`{\varphi}_k(x)=0` for :math:`k<i-1` and :math:`k>i+1`, so only three
basis functions will contribute:

.. math::
        
        \sum_k u_k{\varphi}_k(x) = u_{i-1}{\varphi}_{i-1}(x) +
        u_{i}{\varphi}_{i}(x) + u_{i+1}{\varphi}_{i+1}(x){\thinspace .}
        

The integral :eq:`nonlin:exer:fu:fem:int:global` now takes the
simplified form

.. math::
        
        \int_{x_{i-1}}^{x_{i+1}}
        f(u_{i-1}{\varphi}_{i-1}(x) +
        u_{i}{\varphi}_{i}(x) + u_{i+1}{\varphi}_{i+1}(x)){\varphi}_i(x){\, \mathrm{d}x}{\thinspace .}
        

Split this integral in two integrals over cell L (left),
:math:`[x_{i-1},x_{i}]`, and cell R (right), :math:`[x_{i},x_{i+1}]`. Over
cell L, :math:`u` simplifies to :math:`u_{i-1}{\varphi}_{i-1} + u_{i}{\varphi}_{i}`
(since :math:`{\varphi}_{i+1}=0` on this cell), and over cell R, :math:`u`
simplifies to :math:`u_{i}{\varphi}_{i} + u_{i+1}{\varphi}_{i+1}`.  Make a
``sympy`` program that can compute the integral and write it out as a
difference equation. Give the :math:`f(u)` formula on the command line.
Try out :math:`f(u)=u^2, \sin u, \exp u`.

.. --- begin hint in exercise ---

**Hint.**
Introduce symbols ``u_i``, ``u_im1``, and ``u_ip1`` for :math:`u_i`, :math:`u_{i-1}`,
and :math:`u_{i+1}`, respectively, and similar symbols for :math:`x_i`, :math:`x_{i-1}`,
and :math:`x_{i+1}`. Find formulas for the basis functions on each of the
two cells, make expressions for :math:`u` on the two cells, integrate over
each cell, expand the answer and simplify. You can make
LaTeX code and render it via
`<http://latex.codecogs.com>`_. Here are some appropriate Python statements
for the latter purpose:

        from sympy import *
        ...
        # expr_i holdes the integral as a sympy expression
        latex_code = latex(expr_i, mode='plain')
        # Replace u_im1 sympy symbol name by latex symbol u_{i-1}
        latex_code = latex_code.replace('im1', '{i-1}')
        # Replace u_ip1 sympy symbol name by latex symbol u_{i+1}
        latex_code = latex_code.replace('ip1', '{i+1}')
        # Escape (quote) latex_code so it can be sent as HTML text
        import cgi
        html_code = cgi.escape(latex_code)
        # Make a file with HTML code for displaying the LaTeX formula
        f = open('tmp.html', 'w')
        # Include an image that can be clicked on to yield a new
