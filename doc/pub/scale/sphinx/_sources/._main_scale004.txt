Vibration problems
==================

We shall address a range of different second-order ODEs for mechanical
vibrations and demonstrate how to reason about the scaling in
different physical scenarios.

[**hpl 2**: Include more figures.]

.. _sec:scale:vib:undamped:

Undamped vibrations without forcing
-----------------------------------

The simplest differential equation model for mechanical vibrations
reads

.. _Eq:sec:scale:vib:undamped:model:

.. math::
   :label: sec:scale:vib:undamped:model
        
        mu'' + ku = 0,\quad u(0)=I,\ u'(0)=V{\thinspace .}
        
        

This is a common model for a vibrating body  with mass :math:`m` attached
to a linear spring with spring constant :math:`k` (and force :math:`-ku`).
The quantity :math:`u(t)` measures the displacement of the body.

The first technical steps of scaling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The problem :eq:`sec:scale:vib:undamped:model` has one independent
variable :math:`t` and one dependent variable :math:`u`. We introduce dimensionless
versions of these variables:

.. math::
         \bar u =\frac{u}{u_c},\quad\bar t = \frac{t}{t_c},

where :math:`u_c` and :math:`t_c` are characteristic values of :math:`u` and :math:`t`.
Inserted in :eq:`sec:scale:vib:undamped:model`, we get

.. math::
         m\frac{u_c}{t_c^2}\frac{d^2\bar u}{d\bar t^2} + ku_c\bar u = 0,
        \quad u_c\bar u(0)=I,\quad \frac{u_c}{t_c}\frac{d\bar u}{d\bar t}(0)=V,

resulting in

.. _Eq:sec:scale:vib:undamped:model:scaled0:

.. math::
   :label: sec:scale:vib:undamped:model:scaled0
        
        \frac{d^2\bar u}{d\bar t^2} + \frac{t_c^2 k}{m}\bar u = 0,
        \quad \bar u(0)=\frac{I}{u_c},\ \bar u'(0)=\frac{Vt_c}{u_c}{\thinspace .}
        
        

The exact solution  (1)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What is an appropriate displacement scale :math:`u_c`? The initial condition
:math:`u(0)=I` is a candidate, i.e., :math:`u_c=I`. We also have analytical insight
into this problem, because the exact solution of
:eq:`sec:scale:vib:undamped:model` is quite straightforward to compute.
Let us demonstrate the steps in a SymPy session:

.. code-block:: python

        from sympy import *
        u = symbols('u', cls=Function)
        w = symbols('w', real=True, positive=True)
        I, V, C1, C2 = symbols('I V C1 C2', real=True)
        # Define differential equation: u'' + w**2*u = 0
        def ode(u):
            return diff(u, t, t) + w**2*u
        
        diffeq = ode(u(t))
        # Solve differential equation with dsolve
        s = dsolve(diffeq, u(t))
        # s is an u(t) == expression (Eq obj.), s.rhs grabs the expression
        u_sol = s.rhs
        # The solution contains integration constants C1 and C2
        # but these are not symbols, substitute them by symbols
        u_sol = u_sol.subs('C1', C1).subs('C2', C2)
        # Determine C1 and C2 from the initial conditions
        ic = [u_sol.subs(t, 0) - I, u_sol.diff(t).subs(t, 0) - V]
        print ic
        s = solve(ic, [C1, C2])
        # s is now a dictionary, substitute solution back in u_sol
        u_sol = u_sol.subs(C1, s[C1]).subs(C2, s[C2])
        print u_sol
        
        # Check that the solution fulfills the ODE and init.cond.
        print simplify(ode(u_sol)),
        print u_sol.subs(t, 0) - I, diff(u_sol, t).subs(t, 0) - V

The output is ``I*cos(t*w) + V*sin(t*w)/w``, so we have found that

.. math::
         u(t) = I\cos(\omega t) + \frac{V}{\omega}\sin(\omega t),\quad \omega = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}{\thinspace .}

More insight arises from rewriting such an expression in the form
:math:`A\cos(wt - \phi)`:

.. math::
         u(t) = \sqrt{I^2 + \frac{V^2}{\omega^2}}\cos(wt - \phi),\quad
        \phi = \tan^{-1}(V/(\omega I)){\thinspace .}
        

Now we see that the :math:`u` corresponds to cosine oscillations with a
phase shift :math:`\phi` and amplitude :math:`\sqrt{I^2 + (V/\omega)^2}`.

Discussion of the displacement scale
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The amplitude of :math:`u` is :math:`\sqrt{I^2 + V^2/\omega^2}`, and this
expression is obviously a candidate for :math:`u_c`.  However, the simpler
choice :math:`u_c=\max (I, V/\omega)` is also relevant and more attractive
than the square root expression (but potentially a factor 1.4 wrong
compared to the exact amplitude).  It is not very important to have
:math:`|u|\leq 1`, the point is to avoid :math:`|u|` very small or large.

Discussion of the time scale  (2)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

What is an appropriate time scale? Looking at
:eq:`sec:scale:vib:undamped:model:scaled0` and arguing that
:math:`\bar u''` and :math:`\bar u` both should be around unity in size, the
coefficient :math:`t_c^2k/m` must equal unity, implying that :math:`t_c=\sqrt{m/k}`.
Also from the analytical solution we see that it goes like
sine or cosine of :math:`\omega t` so :math:`1/\omega = \sqrt{m/k}` can be a characteristic
time scale. Likewise, one period of the oscillations, :math:`P=2\pi/\omega` can
be the characteristic time, leading to :math:`t_c=2\pi/\omega`.

With :math:`u_c=I` and :math:`t_c=\sqrt{m/k}` we get the scaled model

.. _Eq:sec:scale:vib:undamped:model:scaled1:

.. math::
   :label: sec:scale:vib:undamped:model:scaled1
        
        \frac{d^2\bar u}{d\bar t^2} + \bar u = 0,
        \quad \bar u(0)=1,\ \bar u'(0)=\alpha,
        
        

where :math:`\alpha` is a dimensionless parameter:

.. math::
         \alpha = \frac{V}{I}\sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}{\thinspace .}

Note that in case :math:`V=0`, we have "scaled away" all physical parameters.
The universal solution without physical parameters is then
:math:`\bar u(\bar t)=\cos\bar t`.

The unscaled solution is recovered as

.. math::
        
        u(t) = I\bar u(\sqrt{k/m}\bar t){\thinspace .}
        

This expressions shows that the scaling is simply a matter of
*stretching or shrinking the axes*.

Alternative displacement scale
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using :math:`u_c = V/\omega`, the equation
is not changed, but the initial conditions become

.. math::
         \bar u(0) = \frac{I}{u_c} = \frac{I\omega}{V} =\frac{I}{V}\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}} = \alpha^{-1},\quad \bar u'(0)=1{\thinspace .}

With :math:`u_c=V/\omega` and one period as time scale,
:math:`t_c=2\pi\sqrt{m/k}`,
we get the alternative model

.. _Eq:sec:scale:vib:undamped:model:scaled2:

.. math::
   :label: sec:scale:vib:undamped:model:scaled2
        
        \frac{d^2\bar u}{d\bar t^2} + 4\pi^2 \bar u = 0,
        \quad \bar u(0)=\alpha^{-1},\ \bar u'(0)=2\pi{\thinspace .}
        
        

The unscaled solution is in this case recovered by

.. math::
        
        u(t) = V\sqrt{\frac{m}{k}}\bar u(2\pi\sqrt{k/m}\bar t){\thinspace .}
        

.. index:: frequency

.. index::
   single: frequency, angular

.. index:: period (of oscillations)

.. index:: radians

.. index:: angular frequency

About frequency and dimensions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The solution goes like :math:`\cos\omega t`, where :math:`\omega =\sqrt{m/k}`
must have dimension 1/s. Actually, :math:`\omega` has dimension *radians
per second*: rad/s. A radian is dimensionless since it is arc (length)
divided by radius (length), but still regarded as a unit.
The period :math:`P` of vibrations is a more intuitive quantity than the frequency
:math:`\omega`. The relation between :math:`P` and :math:`\omega` is :math:`P=2\pi/\omega`.
The number of oscillation cycles per period, :math:`f`, is a more intuitive
measurement of frequency and also known as *frequency*. Therefore, to be
precise, :math:`\omega` should be named *angular frequency*. The relation between
:math:`f` and :math:`T` is :math:`f=1/T`, so :math:`f=2\pi\omega` and measured in Hz (1/s), which is
the unit for counts per unit time.

.. _sec:scale:vib:undamped:mg:

Undamped vibrations with constant forcing
-----------------------------------------

For vertical vibrations in the gravity field, the model
:eq:`sec:scale:vib:undamped:model` must also take the gravity force
:math:`-mg` into account: :math:`mu'' + ku = -mg`. How does this term influence
the scaling? We observe that if there is no movement of the body,
:math:`u''=0`, and the spring elongation matches the gravity force:
:math:`ku = -mg`, leading to a steady displacement :math:`u=-mg/k`. We can then
have oscillations around this equilibrium point. A natural scaling
for :math:`u` is therefore

.. math::
         \bar u = \frac{u - (-mg/k)}{u_c}=\frac{uk + mg}{ku_c}{\thinspace .}

.. u = - mg/k + u_c\bar u

The scaled differential equation with the same time scale as before
(gravity does not influence the oscillations) reads

.. math::
         \frac{d^2\bar u}{d\bar t^2} + \bar u - \frac{t_c^2}{u_c}g
        = -\frac{t_c^2}{u_c}g,

leading to

.. math::
         \frac{d^2\bar u}{d\bar t^2} + \bar u = 0{\thinspace .}

.. _sec:scale:vib:undamped:F:

Undamped vibrations with time-dependent forcing
-----------------------------------------------

Now we add a transient forcing term :math:`F(t)` to the model
:eq:`sec:scale:vib:undamped:model`:

.. _Eq:sec:scale:vib:undamped:F:model:

.. math::
   :label: sec:scale:vib:undamped:F:model
        
        mu'' + ku = F(t),\quad u(0)=I,\ u'(0)=V{\thinspace .}
        
        

Take the forcing to be oscillating

.. math::
         F(t) = A\cos(\psi t){\thinspace .}

The technical steps of the scaling are still the same,

.. _Eq:sec:scale:vib:undamped:F:model:scaled0:

.. math::
   :label: sec:scale:vib:undamped:F:model:scaled0
        
        \frac{d^2\bar u}{d\bar t^2} + \frac{t_c^2 k}{m}\bar u =
        \frac{t_c^2}{mu_c}A\cos(\psi t_c\bar t),
        \quad \bar u(0)=\frac{I}{u_c},\ \bar u'(0)=\frac{Vt_c}{u_c}{\thinspace .}
        
        

What are typical displacement and time scales? This is not so obvious
without knowing the details of the solution, because there are
three parameters (:math:`I`, :math:`V`, and :math:`A`) that influence the magnitude of :math:`u`.
Moreover, there are two time scales, one for the free vibrations of
the systems and one for the forced vibrations :math:`F(t)`.

Investigating scales via analytical solutions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We may look into the exact solution to see what the scales are.  We
continue the SymPy session from the previous section and perform much
of the same steps. Note that we use ``w`` for :math:`\omega = \sqrt{k/m}`.
SymPy may get confused when coefficients in differential equations
contain several symbols. We therefore rewrite the equation with
at most one symbol in each coefficient.
The amplitude :math:`A/m` in the forcing term is of this reason
replaced by the symbol ``A1``.

.. code-block:: python

        A, A1, m, psi = symbols('A A1 m psi', positive=True, real=True)
        def ode(u):
            return diff(u, t, t) + w**2*u - A1*cos(psi*t)
        
        diffeq = ode(u(t))
        u_sol = dsolve(diffeq, u(t))
        u_sol = u_sol.rhs
        
        # Determine the constants C1 and C2 in u_sol
        # (first substitute our own declared C1 and C2 symbols,
        # then use the initial conditions)
        u_sol = u_sol.subs('C1', C1).subs('C2', C2)
        eqs = [u_sol.subs(t, 0) - I, u_sol.diff(t).subs(t, 0) - V]
        s = solve(eqs, [C1, C2])
        u_sol = u_sol.subs(C1, s[C1]).subs(C2, s[C2])
        
        # Check that the solution fulfills the equation and init.cond.
        print simplify(ode(u_sol))
        print simplify(u_sol.subs(t, 0) - I)
        print simplify(diff(u_sol, t).subs(t, 0) - V)
        
        u_sol = simplify(expand(u_sol.subs(A1, A/m)))
        print u_sol

The output from the last line is

.. code-block:: text

        A/m*cos(psi*t)/(-psi**2 + w**2) + V*sin(t*w)/w +
        (A/m + I*psi**2 - I*w**2)*cos(t*w)/(psi**2 - w**2)

With a bit of rewrite this expressions means

.. Note that the solution becomes a bit simpler of F is cos rather than sin

.. math::
         u(t) = \frac{A/m}{\omega^2 - \psi^2}\cos(\psi t) + \frac{V}{\omega}
           \sin(\omega t) +
        \left(\frac{A/m}{\psi^2 - \omega^2} + I\right) \cos (\omega t){\thinspace .}
        

Obviously, this expression is only meaningful for :math:`\psi\neq\omega`. The
case :math:`\psi = \omega` gives an infinite amplitude in this model, a
phenomenon known as resonance. The amplitude becomes finite when
damping is included,
see the section :ref:`sec:scale:vib:damped:F`.

For the case the system starts from rest, :math:`I=V=0`, and the
forcing is the only driving mechanism, we can simplify:

.. math::
        
        u(t) &= \frac{A}{m(\omega^2 - \psi^2)}\cos(\psi t)
        +
        \frac{A}{m(\psi^2 - \omega^2)}\cos (\omega t)\\ 
        &= \frac{A}{m(\omega^2 - \psi^2)}(\cos(\psi t) - \cos(\omega t)){\thinspace .}
        

To gain more insight, :math:`\cos(\psi t) - \cos(\omega t)` can be
rewritten in terms of the mean frequency :math:`(\psi + \omega)/2` and
the difference in frequency :math:`(\psi - \omega)/2`:

.. _Eq:sec:scale:vib:undamped:F:model:sinsin:

.. math::
   :label: sec:scale:vib:undamped:F:model:sinsin
        
        u(t) = \frac{A}{m(\omega^2 - \psi^2)} 2
        \sin\left(\frac{\psi - \omega}{2}t\right)
        \sin\left(\frac{\psi + \omega}{2}t\right),
        
        

showing that there is a signal with frequency :math:`(\psi + \omega)/2`
whose amplitude has a (much) slower frequency
:math:`(\psi - \omega)/2`. Figure :ref:`sec:scale:vib:fig:envelope` shows
an example how such a signal might look like.

.. _sec:scale:vib:fig:envelope:

.. figure:: envelope.png
   :width: 600

   *Signal with frequency 3.1 and envelope frequency 0.2*

The displacement and time scales
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A characteristic displacement can in the latter special case
be taken as :math:`u_c= A/(m(\omega^2 - \psi^2))`. This is also a relevant choice
in the more general case :math:`I\neq0, V\neq 0`, unless :math:`I` or :math:`V`
is so large that it dominates the amplitude
caused by the forcing. With :math:`u_c= A/(m(\omega^2 - \psi^2))` we also
have three special cases: :math:`\omega \ll \psi`, :math:`\omega \gg\psi`, and
:math:`\psi \sim \omega`. In the latter case we need
:math:`u_c= A/(m(\omega^2 - \psi^2))` if we want :math:`|u|\leq 1`. When
:math:`\omega` and :math:`\psi` are significantly different, we may choose one
of them, say :math:`\omega`, and :math:`u_c=A/k`. This is also the relevant scale
if :math:`\omega\gg\psi`. In the opposite case, :math:`\omega\ll\psi`,
:math:`u_c=A/(m\psi^2)`.

The time scale is dominated by the fastest oscillations, which are
of frequency :math:`\psi` or :math:`\omega` when these are close and the largest
of them when they are distant. In any case, we might choose
:math:`t_c=1/\max(\psi,\omega)`.

Finding the displacement scale from the differential equation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Going back to :eq:`sec:scale:vib:undamped:F:model:scaled0`, we
may demand that all the three terms in the differential equation
are of size unity. This leads to :math:`t_c=\sqrt{m/k}`
and :math:`u_c=At_c^2/m = A/k`. The formula for :math:`u_c` is a kind of measure
of the ratio of the
forcing and the spring force (the dimensionless number
:math:`A/(ku_c)` would be this ratio).

Looking at :eq:`sec:scale:vib:undamped:F:model:sinsin`, we see
that if :math:`\psi\ll\omega`, the amplitude can be approximated
by :math:`A/(m\omega^2)=A/k`, showing that the scale :math:`u_c=A/k` is
relevant for small excitation frequency :math:`\psi` compared to
the free vibration frequency :math:`\omega`.

Scaling with free vibrations as time scale
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We first choose the time scale based on the free oscillations
with frequency :math:`\omega`, i.e., :math:`t_c=1/\omega`. Inserting the expression in
:eq:`sec:scale:vib:undamped:F:model:scaled0` results in

.. _Eq:sec:scale:vib:undamped:F:model:scaled2:

.. math::
   :label: sec:scale:vib:undamped:F:model:scaled2
        
        \frac{d^2\bar u}{d\bar t^2} + \bar u =
        \gamma
        \cos(\delta\bar t),
        \quad \bar u(0)=\alpha,\ \bar u'(0)=\beta{\thinspace .}
        
        

Here we have four dimensionless variables

.. math::
        
        \alpha = \frac{I}{u_c},
        

.. math::
          
        \beta  = \frac{Vt_c}{u_c} = \frac{V}{\omega u_c},
        

.. math::
          
        \gamma = \frac{t_c^2 A}{mu_c} = frac{A}{ku_c},
        

.. math::
          
        \delta = \frac{t_c}{\psi^{-1}} = \frac{\psi}{\omega}{\thinspace .}
        

These dimensionless variables have interpretations as ratios of
physical effects:

 * :math:`\alpha`: ratio of the initial displacement and
   the typical displacement :math:`u_c`,

 * :math:`\beta`: ratio of the initial velocity
   and the typical velocity measure :math:`u_c/t_c`,

 * :math:`\gamma`: ratio of
   the forcing :math:`A` and the mass times acceleration :math:`mu_c/t_c^2` *or*
   the ratio of the forcing and the spring force :math:`ku_c`

 * :math:`\delta`: ratio of the
   frequencies or the time scales of the forcing and the free vibrations.

Software  (3)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Any solver for :eq:`sec:scale:vib:undamped:F:model:scaled0`
can be used for :eq:`sec:scale:vib:undamped:F:model:scaled2`.
In particular, we may use the ``solver`` function in the
file `vib.py <http://tinyurl.com/nm5587k/vib/vib.py>`__:

.. code-block:: python

        def solver(I, V, m, b, s, F, dt, T, damping='linear'):

for solving

.. math::
         mu'' + f(u') + s(u) = F(t),\quad u(0)=I,\ u'(0)=V,\ t\in (0,T],

with time steps ``dt``. For ``damping='linear'``, we have :math:`f(u')=bu'`. The
other value is ``'quadratic'``, meaning :math:`f(u')=b|u'|u'`.
Given :math:`\alpha`, :math:`\beta`, :math:`\gamma`, and :math:`\delta`,
and appropriate call is

.. code-block:: python

        u, t = solver(I=alpha, V=beta, m=1, b=0,
                      s=lambda u: u, F=lambda t: gamma*cos(delta*t),
        	      dt=2*pi/n, T=2*pi*P)

where ``n`` is the number intervals per period and ``P`` is the number
of periods to be simulated.

We way wrap this call in a ``solver_scaled`` function as we did in
the section :ref:`sec:scale:decay:prog`, but this is done in
the section :ref:`sec:scale:vib:damped:F`.

Choice of :math:`u_c` close to resonance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We have chosen not to specify :math:`u_c` in the formulas above. Now we shall
discuss various choices of :math:`u_c`.
Close to resonance, when :math:`\psi\sim\omega`, we may set
:math:`u_c=A/(m(\omega^2 - \psi^2))`. The dimensionless numbers
become in this case

.. math::
        
        \alpha &= \frac{I}{u_c} = \frac{I}{A/k}(1-\delta^2),\\ 
        \beta  &= \frac{V}{\omega u_c} = \frac{V\sqrt{km}}{A}(1-\delta^2),\\ 
        \gamma &= \frac{A}{ku_c} = 1-\delta^2,\\ 
        \delta &= \frac{\psi}{\omega}{\thinspace .}
        

With :math:`\psi = 0.99\omega`, :math:`\delta =0.99`, :math:`V=0`,
:math:`\alpha = \gamma = 1-\delta^2 = 0.02`, we have the problem

.. math::
        
        \frac{d^2\bar u}{d\bar t^2} + \bar u =
        0.02 \cos(0.99\bar t),
        \quad \bar u(0)=0.02,\ \bar u'(0)=0{\thinspace .}
        

This is a problem with a very small initial condition and a very small
forcing, but the state close to resonance brings the amplitude up to
about unity, see the result of numerical simulations with :math:`\delta=0.99` in
Figure :ref:`sec:scale:vib:fig:Fcos_b0:1`.
Neglecting :math:`\alpha`,
the solution is given by :eq:`sec:scale:vib:undamped:F:model:sinsin`,
which here means :math:`A=1-\delta^2`, :math:`m=1`, :math:`\omega=1`, :math:`\psi=\delta`:

.. math::
         \bar u(\bar t) = 2\sin(-0.005\bar t)\sin(0.995\bar t){\thinspace .} 

Note that this is a problem which demands very high accuracy in the
numerical calculations. Using 20 time steps per period gives a
significant phase error and an amplitude of about 1.4. We used
160 steps per period for the results in
Figure :ref:`sec:scale:vib:fig:Fcos_b0:1`.

Unit size of all terms in the ODE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Using the displacement scale :math:`u_c=A/k` leads to
:eq:`sec:scale:vib:undamped:F:model:scaled2` with

.. math::
        
        \alpha &= \frac{I}{u_c} = \frac{I}{A/k},\\ 
        \beta  &= \frac{V}{\omega u_c} = \frac{V k}{A\omega},\\ 
        \gamma &= \frac{A}{ku_c} = 1,\\ 
        \delta &= \frac{\psi}{\omega}{\thinspace .}
        

Simulating a case with :math:`\delta=0.5`, :math:`\alpha=1`, and :math:`\beta=0` gives
the oscillations in Figure :ref:`sec:scale:vib:fig:Fcos_b0:2`, which is
a case away from resonance, and the amplitude is about unity. However,
choosing :math:`\delta =0.99` (close to resonance) results in a figure
similar to Figure :ref:`sec:scale:vib:fig:Fcos_b0:1`, except that the
amplitude is about :math:`10^2` because of the moderate size of :math:`u_c`.
The present scaling is therefore most suitable away from resonance,
and when the terms containing :math:`\cos\omega t` and :math:`\sin\omega t`
are important (e.g., :math:`\omega\gg\psi`).

   *Forced undamped vibrations away from resonance*

Choice of :math:`u_c` when :math:`\psi\gg\omega`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Finally, we may look at the case where :math:`\psi\gg\omega` such that
:math:`u_c=A/(m\psi^2)` is a relevant scale (i.e., omitting :math:`\omega^2` compared to
:math:`\psi^2` in the denominator), but in this case we should
use :math:`t_c=1/\psi` since the variations in the force are much greater
than in the free vibrations of the system.
This choice of :math:`t_c` changes the scaled ODE to

.. _Eq:sec:scale:vib:undamped:F:model:scaled6:

.. math::
   :label: sec:scale:vib:undamped:F:model:scaled6
        
        \frac{d^2\bar u}{d\bar t^2} + \delta^{-2}\bar u =
        \gamma
        \cos(\bar t),
        \quad \bar u(0)=\alpha,\ \bar u'(0)=\beta,
        
        

where

.. math::
        
        \alpha &= \frac{I}{u_c} = \frac{I}{A/k}\delta^2,\\ 
        \beta  &= \frac{Vt_c}{u_c} = \frac{V\sqrt{km}}{A}\delta,\\ 
        \gamma &= \frac{t_c^2 A}{mu_c} = 1,\\ 
        \delta &= \frac{t_c}{\psi^{-1}} = \frac{\psi}{\omega}{\thinspace .}
        

In the regime :math:`\psi\gg\omega`, :math:`\delta\gg 1`, thus making :math:`\alpha` and
:math:`\beta` large.
However, if :math:`\alpha` and/or :math:`\beta` is large,
the initial condition dominates over the forcing, and will also dominate
the amplitude of :math:`u`, thereby making the scaling of :math:`u` inappropriate.
In case :math:`I=V=0` so that :math:`\alpha=\beta=`,
:eq:`sec:scale:vib:undamped:F:model:sinsin` predicts
(:math:`A=m=1`, :math:`\omega=\delta^{-1}`, :math:`\psi=1`)

.. math::
         \bar u(\bar t) = (\delta^{-2}-1)^{-1}2
        \sin\left(\frac{1}{2}(1 -\delta^{-1})\bar t\right)
        \sin\left(\frac{1}{2}(1 +\delta^{-1})\bar t\right),
        

which has an amplitude about :math:`2` for :math:`\delta\gg 1`, i.e.,
very small amplitude. Figure :ref:`sec:scale:vib:fig:Fcos_b0:3` shows
numerical simulations with 160 time steps per period of :math:`F(t)`.

.. _sec:scale:vib:fig:Fcos_b0:3:

   *Forced undamped vibrations with rapid forcing*

With :math:`\alpha=0.05\delta^2=5`, we get a significant contribution from
the free vibrations (the homogeneous solution of the ODE) as
shown in Figure :ref:`sec:scale:vib:fig:Fcos_b0:4`. For larger :math:`\alpha`
values, one must base

   *Forced undamped vibrations with rapid forcing and initial displacement of 5*

Displacement scale based on :math:`I`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Choosing :math:`u_c=I` gives

.. _Eq:sec:scale:vib:undamped:F:model:scaled5:

.. math::
   :label: sec:scale:vib:undamped:F:model:scaled5
        
        \frac{d^2\bar u}{d\bar t^2} + \bar u =
        \gamma\cos(\delta\bar t),
        \quad \bar u(0)=1,\ \bar u'(0)=\beta,
        
        

with

.. math::
        
        \beta  = \frac{V}{I}\sqrt\frac{{m}{k}} = \frac{Vt_c}{u_c},
        \gamma  = \frac{A}{kI} = \frac{tc^2A}{mu_c} = \frac{A}{ku_c}{\thinspace .}
        

This scaling is not relevant close to resonance since then :math:`u_c\gg I`.

.. _sec:scale:vib:damped:F:

Damped vibrations with forcing
------------------------------

We now introduce a linear damping force :math:`bu'(t)` in the equation of motion:

.. _Eq:sec:scale:vib:damped:F:model:

.. math::
   :label: sec:scale:vib:damped:F:model
        
        mu'' + bu' + ku = A\cos(\psi t),\quad u(0)=I,\ u'(0)=V{\thinspace .}
        
        

Scaling results in

.. _Eq:sec:scale:vib:damped:F:model:scaled0:

.. math::
   :label: sec:scale:vib:damped:F:model:scaled0
        
        \frac{d^2\bar u}{d\bar t^2} + \frac{t_c b}{m}\frac{d\bar u}{d\bar t}
        + \frac{t_c^2 k}{m}\bar u =
        \frac{t_c^2}{mu_c}A\cos(\psi t_c\bar t),
        \quad \bar u(0)=\frac{I}{u_c},\ \bar u'(0)=\frac{Vt_c}{u_c}{\thinspace .}
        
        

The exact solution  (2)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To choose scales, it is a great advantage to look into exact solutions.
Using SymPy to solve :eq:`sec:scale:vib:damped:F:model` turns out
to be difficult, because with damping, we have three solutions
of :eq:`sec:scale:vib:damped:F:model`, and for vibrations we are
only interested in one of them, the one with damped oscillations.
So we have to drop ``dsolve`` and perform manual steps, either by
hand or with the aid of SymPy. The solution is composed of a homogeneous
solution :math:`u_h` of :math:`mu'' + bu' + ku=0` and one particular solution :math:`u_p`
of the nonhomogeneous equation
:math:`mu'' + bu' + ku=A\cos(\psi t)`. The homogeneous solution with
damped oscillations (requiring :math:`b < 2\sqrt{mk}`) can be
found by the following code. We have divided the differential equation
by :math:`m` and introduced :math:`B=\frac{1}{2}b/m` and let ``A1`` represent
:math:`A/m` to simplify expressions and
help SymPy with less symbols in the equation. Without these simplifications,
SymPy stalls in the computations due to too many symbols in the equation.

.. code-block:: python

        u = symbols('u', cls=Function)
        t, w, B, A, A1, m, psi = symbols('t w B A A1 m psi',
                                         positive=True, real=True)
        
        def ode(u, homogeneous=True):
            h = diff(u, t, t) + 2*B*diff(u, t) + w**2*u
            f = A1*cos(psi*t)
            return h if homogeneous else h - f
        
        # Find coefficients in polynomial (in r) for exp(r*t) ansatz
        r = symbols('r')
        ansatz = exp(r*t)
        poly = simplify(ode(ansatz)/ansatz)
        
        # Convert to polynomial to extract coefficients
        poly = Poly(poly, r)
        # Extract coefficients in poly: a_*t**2 + b_*t + c_
        a_, b_, c_ = poly.coeffs()
        # Assume b_**2 - 4*a_*c_ < 0
        d = -b_/(2*a_)
        if a_ == 1:
            omega = sqrt(c_ - (b_/2)**2)  # nicer formula
        else:
            omega = sqrt(4*a_*c_ - b_**2)/(2*a_)
        
        # The homogeneous solution is a linear combination of a
        # cos term (u1) and a sin term (u2)
        u1 = exp(d*t)*cos(omega*t)
        u2 = exp(d*t)*sin(omega*t)
        C1, C2, V, I = symbols('C1 C2 V I', real=True)
        u_h = simplify(C1*u1 + C2*u2)
        print 'u_h:', u_h

The print out shows

.. math::
         u_h = e^{-Bt}\left(C_1 \cos(\sqrt{\omega^2 - B^2}t) +
        C_2 \sin(\sqrt{\omega^2 - B^2}t)\right),

where :math:`C_1` and :math:`C_2` must be determined by the initial conditions later.
It is wise to check that :math:`u_h` is indeed a solution of the homogeneous
differential equation:

.. code-block:: python

        assert simplify(ode(u_h)) == 0

The ansatz for the particular solution :math:`u_p` is

.. math::
         u_p= C_3\cos(\psi t) + C_4\sin(\psi t),

which inserted in the ODE gives two equations
for :math:`C_3` and :math:`C_4`. The relevant SymPy statements are

.. code-block:: python

        # Particular solution
        C3, C4 = symbols('C3 C4')
        u_p = C3*cos(psi*t) + C4*sin(psi*t)
        eqs = simplify(ode(u_p, homogeneous=False))
        
        # Collect cos(omega*t) terms
        print 'eqs:', eqs
        eq_cos = simplify(eqs.subs(sin(psi*t), 0).subs(cos(psi*t), 1))
        eq_sin = simplify(eqs.subs(cos(psi*t), 0).subs(sin(psi*t), 1))
        s = solve([eq_cos, eq_sin], [C3, C4])
        u_p = simplify(u_p.subs(C3, s[C3]).subs(C4, s[C4]))
        
        # Check that the solution is correct
        assert simplify(ode(u_p, homogeneous=False)) == 0

Using the initial conditions for the complete solution :math:`u=u_h+u_p`
determines :math:`C_1` and :math:`C_2`:

.. code-block:: python

        u_sol = u_h + u_p  # total solution
        # Initial conditions
        eqs = [u_sol.subs(t, 0) - I, u_sol.diff(t).subs(t, 0) - V]
        # Determine C1 and C2 from the initial conditions
        s = solve(eqs, [C1, C2])
        u_sol = u_sol.subs(C1, s[C1]).subs(C2, s[C2])

Finally, we should check that ``u_sol`` is indeed the correct solution:

.. code-block:: python

        checks = dict(
            ODE=simplify(expand(ode(u_sol, homogeneous=False))),
            IC1=simplify(u_sol.subs(t, 0) - I),
            IC2=simplify(diff(u_sol, t).subs(t, 0) - V))
        for check in checks:
            msg = '%s residual: %s' % (check, checks[check])
            assert checks[check] == sympify(0), msg

Finally, we may take ``u_sol = u_sol.subs(A, A/m)`` to get the right
expression for the solution.
Using ``latex(u_sol)`` results in a huge expression, which should be
manually ordered to something like the following:

.. math::
         u = &
        \frac{Am^{-1}}{4 B^{2} \psi^{2} +
        \Omega^{2}} \left(2 B \psi
        \sin{\left (\psi t \right )} - \Omega\cos{\left (\psi t \right )}\right) + \\ 
        &
        {e^{-B t}} \biggl(
        C_1 \cos{\left( t \sqrt{\omega^{2}- B^{2}}\right)} +
        C_2 \sin{\left (t \sqrt{\omega^{2}- B^{2}}\right )}\biggr)\\ 
        C_1 &= \frac{Am^{-1} \Omega + 4 I B^{2} \psi^{2} +
        I\Omega^2}{
        4 B^{2} \psi^{2} + \Omega^2}\\ 
        C_2 &=
        \frac{- Am^{-1} B\Omega + 4 I B^{3} \psi^{2} +
        I B\Omega^2 + 4 V B^{2}\psi^{2} +
        V\Omega^2}{
        \sqrt{\omega^{2} - B^{2}}
        \left(4 B^{2} \psi^{2} + \Omega^2\right)},\\ 
        \Omega &= \psi^2 - \omega^2{\thinspace .}
        

.. index:: quality factor Q

.. index:: phase shift

The most important feature of this solution is that there are
two time scales with frequencies :math:`\psi` and :math:`\sqrt{\omega^2 - B^2}`,
but the latter appears in terms that decay as :math:`e^{Bt}` in time.
The attention is usually on longer periods of time, so in that
case the solution simplifies to

.. math::
        
        u = \frac{Am^{-1}}{4 B^{2} \psi^{2} +
        \Omega^{2}} \left(2 B \psi
        \sin{\left (\psi t \right )} - \Omega\cos{\left (\psi t \right )}\right)
        \nonumber
        

.. math::
          
        = \frac{A}{m}\frac{1}{\sqrt{4B^2\psi^2 + \Omega^2}}\cos(\psi t + \phi)
        \frac{(\psi\omega)^{-1}}{(\psi\omega)^{-1}}
        \nonumber
        

.. _Eq:sec:scale:vib:damped:F:model:u_forced0:

.. math::
   :label: sec:scale:vib:damped:F:model:u_forced0
          
         = \frac{A}{k} Q\delta^{-1}\left(1 + Q^2(\delta - \delta^{-1})\right)^{-
        \frac{1}{2}}\cos(\psi t + \phi),
        
        

where we have introduced the dimensionless numbers

.. math::
         Q = \frac{\omega}{2B},\quad\delta = \frac{\psi}{\omega},

and

.. math::
         \phi = \tan^{-1}\left(-\frac{2B}{\omega^2 - \psi^2}\right)
        = \tan^{-1}\left(\frac{Q^{-1}}{\delta^2 - 1}\right){\thinspace .}

:math:`Q` is commonly called *quality factor* and :math:`\phi` is the
*phase shift*. Dividing
:eq:`sec:scale:vib:damped:F:model:u_forced0` by :math:`A/k`, which is a common
scale for :math:`u`, gives the dimensionless relation

.. _Eq:sec:scale:vib:damped:F:model:u_forced:

.. math::
   :label: sec:scale:vib:damped:F:model:u_forced
        
        \frac{u}{A/k} = \frac{Q}{\delta} R(Q,\delta)^{\frac{1}{2}}\cos(\psi t + \phi),
        \quad
        R(Q,\delta) = \left(1 + Q^2(\delta - \delta^{-1})\right)^{-1}{\thinspace .}
        
        

Choosing scales
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Much of the discussion about scales in the previous sections are
relevant also with damping is included.
Although the oscillations with frequency :math:`\sqrt{\omega^2-B^2}`
die out for :math:`t\gg B^{-1}`, we start with using this frequency for
the time scale.
A highly relevant assumption for engineering applications of
:eq:`sec:scale:vib:damped:F:model` is that the damping is small.
Therefore, :math:`\sqrt{\omega^2-B^2}` is close to :math:`\omega` and we
simply apply :math:`t_c=1/\omega` as before.

The coefficient in front of the :math:`\bar u'` term then becomes

.. math::
         \frac{b}{m\omega} = \frac{2B}{\omega} = Q^{-1}{\thinspace .}

Choice of :math:`u_c` at resonance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The relevant scale for :math:`u_c` at or nearby resonance (:math:`\psi = \omega`)
becomes different from the previous section, since with damping,
the maximum amplitude a finite value. For :math:`t\gg 1/B` when the
:math:`\sin\psi t` term is dominating, we have for :math:`\psi = \omega`:

.. math::
         u = \frac{Am^{-1}2B\psi}{4B^2\psi^2}\sin (\psi t) =
        \frac{A}{2Bm\psi}\sin (\psi t) =
        \frac{A}{b\psi}\sin (\psi t)
        {\thinspace .}
        

This motivates the choice

.. math::
         u_c = \frac{A}{b\psi} = \frac{A}{b\omega}{\thinspace .}

(It is wise during computations like this to stop and check the
dimensions: :math:`A` must be :math:`[\hbox{MLT}^{-2}]` from the original
equation (:math:`F(t)` must have same dimension as :math:`mu''`),
:math:`bu'` also has dimension :math:`[\hbox{MLT}^{-2}]`, implying that
:math:`b` has dimension :math:`[\hbox{MT}^{-1}]`. :math:`A/b` then has dimension
:math:`LT^{-1}`, and :math:`A/(b\psi)` gets dimension :math:`[L]`, which matches
what we want for :math:`u_c`.)

The differential equation on dimensionless form becomes

.. _Eq:sec:scale:vib:damped:F:model:scaled1:

.. math::
   :label: sec:scale:vib:damped:F:model:scaled1
        
        \frac{d^2\bar u}{d\bar t^2} + Q^{-1}\frac{d\bar u}{d\bar t} + \bar u =
        \gamma
        \cos(\delta\bar t),
        \quad \bar u(0)=\alpha,\ \bar u'(0)=\beta,
        
        

with

.. \frac{A}{b\omega}

.. math::
        
        \alpha = \frac{I}{u_c} = \frac{Ib}{A}\sqrt{\frac{k}{m}},
        

.. math::
          
        \beta  = \frac{Vt_c}{u_c} = \frac{Vb}{A},
        

.. math::
          
        \gamma = \frac{t_c^2 A}{mu_c} = \frac{b\omega}{k},
        

.. math::
          
        \delta = \frac{t_c}{\psi^{-1}} = \frac{\psi}{\omega} = 1{\thinspace .}
        

Choice of :math:`u_c` when :math:`\omega\gg\psi`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the limit :math:`\omega\gg\psi` and :math:`t\gg 1/B`,

.. math::
         u \approx \frac{A}{m\omega^2}\cos\psi t = \frac{A}{k}\cos\psi t,

showing that :math:`u_c=A/k` is an appropriate displacement scale.
(Alternatively, we get this scale also from :math:`\gamma=1` in the ODE.)
The dimensionless numbers :math:`\alpha`, :math:`\beta`, and :math:`\delta` are as
for the forced vibrations without damping.

Choice of :math:`u_c` when :math:`\omega\ll\psi`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the limit :math:`\omega\ll\psi`, we should base :math:`t_c` on the rapid
variations in the excitation, :math:`t_c=1/\psi`.

Oscillating electric circuits
-----------------------------

The differential equation for an oscillating electric circuit is
very similar to the equation for forced, damped,
mechanical vibrations, and their
dimensionless form is identical.
The current :math:`I(t)` in a
circuit with an inductor with inductance :math:`L`, a capacitor with
capacitance :math:`C`, and overall resistance :math:`R`, obeys the equation

.. math::
        
        \ddot I + \frac{R}{L}\dot I + \frac{1}{LC}I = \dot V(t),
        

where :math:`V(t)` is the voltage source powering the circuit.
We introduce

.. math::
         \bar I=\frac{I}{I_c},\quad \bar t = \frac{t}{t_c},

and get

.. math::
         \frac{d^2\bar I}{d\bar t^2} + \frac{t_c R}{L}\frac{d\bar I}{d\bar t}
        + \frac{t_c^2}{LC}\bar I = \frac{t_c^2V_c}{I_c} \bar V(t){\thinspace .}

Here, we have scaled :math:`V(t)` according to

.. math::
         \bar V(bar t) = \frac{V(t_c\bar t)}{\max_t V(t)}{\thinspace .}

The time scale :math:`t_c` is chosen to make :math:`\ddot I` and :math:`I/(LC)` balance,
:math:`t_c = \sqrt{LC}`.
Choosing :math:`I_c` to make the coefficient in the source term of unit size,
means :math:`I_c = LCV_c`.
With

.. math::
         \alpha = \frac{R}{2}\sqrt{\frac{C}{L}},

we get the scaled equation

.. math::
        
        \frac{d^2\bar I}{d\bar t^2} + 2\alpha\frac{d\bar I}{d\bar t}
        + \bar I = \bar V(t){\thinspace .}
        

Two additional dimensionless variables will arise from the initial
conditions for :math:`I`.
