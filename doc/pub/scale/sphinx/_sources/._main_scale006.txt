The diffusion equation
======================

The diffusion equation in a one-dimensional homogeneous medium reads

.. _Eq:sec:scale:diffu:pde1:

.. math::
   :label: sec:scale:diffu:pde1
        
        \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} =
        {\alpha}\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}, \quad  x\in (0,L),\ t\in (0,T],
        
        

where :math:`{\alpha}` is the diffusion coefficient. The
multi-dimensional generalization to a heterogeneous medium
and a force term takes the form

.. _Eq:sec:scale:diffu:pde1:3D:

.. math::
   :label: sec:scale:diffu:pde1:3D
        
        \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} =
        \nabla\cdot\left({\alpha} \nabla u\right) + f, \quad  x,y,z\in \Omega,\ t\in (0,T]{\thinspace .}
        
        

We first look at scaling the PDE itself, and thereafter we discuss
some types of boundary conditions and how to scale the complete
initial-boundary value problem.

Homogeneous diffusion equation
------------------------------

Simplified 1D PDE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To make :eq:`sec:scale:diffu:pde1` dimensionless,
we introduce as usual dimensionless dependent and independent variables:

.. math::
         \bar x = \frac{x}{x_c},
        \quad \bar t = \frac{t}{t_c}, \quad \bar u =\frac{u}{u_c}{\thinspace .}

Inserting the dimensionless quantities in the one-dimensional
PDE :eq:`sec:scale:diffu:pde1` results in

.. _Eq:sec:scale:diffu:pde1:d0:

.. math::
   :label: sec:scale:diffu:pde1:d0
        
        \frac{\partial \bar u}{\partial \bar t} =
        \frac{t_c{\alpha}}{L^2}
        \frac{\partial^2 \bar u}{\partial \bar x^2}, \quad  \bar x\in (0,1),\ \bar t\in (0,\bar T = T/t_c]{\thinspace .}
        
        

Arguing as for the wave equation that the scaling should result in

.. math::
         \frac{\partial \bar u}{\partial \bar t}\hbox{ and }
        \frac{\partial^2 \bar u}{\partial \bar x^2}

of the same size (about unity),
implies :math:`t_c{\alpha}/L^2=1` and therefore :math:`t_c = L^2/{\alpha}`.

Insight through an analytical solution can alternatively
help with choosing :math:`t_c`.
One can show that :math:`u=Ae^{-pt}\sin (kx)` is a solution of
:eq:`sec:scale:diffu:pde1:d0` if :math:`p={\alpha} k^2`, for any :math:`k`. Exponential decay in
time is a characteristic feature of the diffusion equation, and
the e-folding time can then be taken as a time scale. This means
:math:`t_c = 1/p \sim k^{-2}`. Since :math:`k` is related to the spatial
wave length :math:`\lambda`
through :math:`k=2\pi/\lambda`, it means that :math:`t_c` depends strongly on the wave
length of the sine term :math:`\sin(kx)`.
In particular, short waves (as found in noisy signals) with
large :math:`k` decay very rapidly.
For the overall solution we are interested in how the longest meaningful
wave decays and use that time scale for :math:`t_c`. The longest wave
typically has half a wave length over the domain :math:`[0,L]`:
:math:`u = Ae^{-pt}\sin(\pi x/L)` (:math:`k=\pi/L`). Then :math:`t_c=L^2/{\alpha} \pi^{-2}`,
but factor :math:`\pi^{-2}` is not important and we simply choose
:math:`t_c=L^2/{\alpha}`, which equals the time scale we arrived at above.
We may say that :math:`t_c` is the time it takes for the diffusion to
significantly change the solution in the entire domain.

Another fundamental solution of the diffusion equation is the
diffusion of a Gaussian function: :math:`u(x,t)=(4\pi{\alpha}
t)^{-1/2}\exp{(-x^2/(4{\alpha} t))}`. For the diffusion to be significant
at a distance :math:`x=L`, we may demand the exponential factor to have a
value of :math:`e^{-1}\approx 0.37`, which implies :math:`t=L^2/(4{\alpha})`, but the
factor 4 is not of importance, so again, a relevant time scale is
:math:`t_c=L^2/{\alpha}`.

The scale :math:`u_c` is chosen according to the initial condition:
:math:`u_c=\max_{x\in(0,L)}|I(x)|`. For a diffusion equation :math:`u_t={\alpha} u_{xx}`
with :math:`u=0` at the boundaries :math:`x=0,L`, the solution is bounded by
the initial condition :math:`I(x)`. Therefore, the listed choice of :math:`u_c`
implies that
:math:`|u|\leq 1`. (The solution :math:`u=Ae^{-pt}\sin (kx)` is such an example
if :math:`k=n\pi/L` for integer :math:`n` such that :math:`u=0` for :math:`x=0` and :math:`x=L`.)

The resulting dimensionless PDE becomes

.. _Eq:sec:scale:diffu:pde1:d:

.. math::
   :label: sec:scale:diffu:pde1:d
        
        \frac{\partial \bar u}{\partial \bar t} =
        \frac{\partial^2 \bar u}{\partial \bar x^2}, \quad  \bar x\in (0,1),\ \bar t\in (0,\bar T],
        
        

with initial condition

.. math::
         \bar u(\bar x, 0) = \bar I(\bar x) = \frac{I(x_c\bar x)}{\max_x |I(x)|}{\thinspace .}

Notice that :eq:`sec:scale:diffu:pde1:d` is without physical parameters!

Generalized PDE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Turning the attention to :eq:`sec:scale:diffu:pde1:3D`, we introduce
the dimensionless diffusion coefficient

.. math::
         \bar{\alpha}(\bar x,\bar y,\bar z) =
        {\alpha}_c^{-1}{\alpha} (x_c\bar x, y_c\bar y, z_c\bar z),

typically with

.. math::
         {\alpha}_c = \max_{x,y,z}{\alpha}(x,y,z){\thinspace .}

The length scales are

.. math::
         \bar x = \frac{x}{x_c},\quad \bar y = \frac{y}{y_c},\quad
        \bar z = \frac{z}{z_c}{\thinspace .}
        

We scale :math:`f` in a similar fashion:

.. math::
         \bar f(\bar x, \bar y, \bar z, \bar t)
        = f_c^{-1}f(\bar xx_c, \bar yy_c \bar zz_c, \bar tt_c),

with

.. math::
         f_c = \max_{x,y,z,t}|f(x,y,z,t)|{\thinspace .}

Also assuming
that :math:`x_c=y_c=z_c=L`, and :math:`u_c=\max_{x,y,z}(I(x,y,z)`,
we end up with the scaled PDE

.. _Eq:sec:scale:diffu:pde1:3D:d:

.. math::
   :label: sec:scale:diffu:pde1:3D:d
        
        \frac{\partial \bar u}{\partial \bar t} =
        \nabla\cdot\left(\bar{\alpha} \bar\nabla \bar u\right) + \beta f, \quad  \bar x,\bar y,\bar z\in \bar \Omega,\ \bar t\in (0,\bar T]{\thinspace .}
        
        

Here, :math:`\bar\nabla` means differentiation with respect to dimensionless
coordinates :math:`\bar x`, :math:`\bar y`, and :math:`\bar z`. The dimensionless parameter
:math:`\beta` takes the form

.. math::
         \beta = \frac{t_cf_c}{u_c} = \frac{L^2}{{\alpha}}
        \frac{\max_{x,y,z,t}|f(x,y,z,t)|}{\max_{x,y,z}|I(x,y,z)|}{\thinspace .}

The scaled initial condition is :math:`\bar u = \bar I` as in the 1D case.

An alternative choice :math:`u_c` is to make the coefficient :math:`t_cf_c/u_c`
in the source term unity. The scaled PDE now becomes

.. _Eq:sec:scale:diffu:pde1:3D:d2:

.. math::
   :label: sec:scale:diffu:pde1:3D:d2
        
        \frac{\partial \bar u}{\partial \bar t} =
        \nabla\cdot\left(\bar{\alpha} \bar\nabla \bar u\right) + f,
        
        

but the initial condition features the :math:`\beta` parameter:

.. math::
         \bar u(\bar x, \bar y, \bar z, 0) = \frac{I}{t_cf_c} =
        \beta^{-1}\bar I(\bar x,\bar y,\bar z){\thinspace .}
        

We may check that :math:`\beta` is really non-dimensional. From the PDE,
:math:`f` must have the same dimensions as :math:`\partial u/\partial t`, i.e.,
:math:`[\Theta\hbox{T}^{-1}]`.
The dimension of :math:`{\alpha}` is more intricate, but from the term
:math:`{\alpha} u_{xx}` we know that :math:`u_{xx}` has dimensions :math:`[\Theta\hbox{L}^{-2}]`,
and then :math:`{\alpha}` must have dimension :math:`\hbox{L}^2\hbox{T}^{-1}]`
to match the target :math:`[\Theta\hbox{T}^{-1}]`.
In the expression for :math:`\beta` we get
:math:`[\hbox{L}^2\Theta\hbox{T}^{-1}(\hbox{L}^2\hbox{T}^{-1}\Theta)^{-1}]`,
which equals 1 as it should.

Jump boundary condition
-----------------------

A classical one-dimensional
heat conduction problem goes as follows. An insulated rod
at some constant temperature :math:`U_0` is suddenly heated from one end
(:math:`x=0`), modeled as a constant Dirichlet condition :math:`u(0,t)=U_L\neq U_0`
at that end. That is, the boundary temperature jumps from :math:`U_0` to :math:`U_1`
at :math:`t=0`. All the other surfaces of the rod are insulated such that
a one-dimensional model is appropriate.
Heat cannot escape, and we supply heat at :math:`x=0` at the temperature :math:`U_1`,
which will warm up all of the material to the temperature :math:`U_1`.
That is, :math:`u\rightarrow U_1` as :math:`t\rightarrow\infty`.

The initial-boundary value problem reads

.. _Eq:scale:heat:pde3:

.. math::
   :label: scale:heat:pde3
        
        \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} =
        {\alpha} \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2},
        \quad   x\in (0,L),\ t\in (0, T],
        
        

.. _Eq:scale:heat:pde3:ic:u:

.. math::
   :label: scale:heat:pde3:ic:u
          
        u(x,0) = U_0,
        \quad  x\in [0,L],
        
        

.. _Eq:scale:heat:pde3:bc:0:

.. math::
   :label: scale:heat:pde3:bc:0
          
        u(0, t)  = U_1,
        \quad   t\in (0, T],
        
        

.. _Eq:scale:heat:pde3:bc:L:

.. math::
   :label: scale:heat:pde3:bc:L
          
        \frac{\partial}{\partial x} u(L, t)  = 0,
        \quad  t\in (0, T].
        
        

The diffusion coefficient is related to heat transfer parameters
by :math:`{\alpha} = k/(\varrho c)`, where :math:`k` is the heat conduction coefficient,
:math:`\varrho` is the density, and :math:`c` is a specific heat capacity parameter.

The natural dimensionless temperature for this problem is

.. math::
         \bar u = \frac{u - U_0}{U_1 - U_0},

since this choice makes :math:`\bar u\in [0,1]`. The reason is that :math:`u` is bounded by
the initial and boundary conditions (in the absence of a source term),
and we have
:math:`\bar u(\bar x,0)=0`, :math:`\bar u(\bar x,\infty)=1`, and :math:`\bar u(0,\bar t)=1`.

The choice of :math:`t_c` is as in the previous cases. We arrive at
the dimensionless initial-boundary value problem

.. _Eq:scale:heat:pde3:d:

.. math::
   :label: scale:heat:pde3:d
        
        \frac{\partial \bar u}{\partial \bar t} =
        \frac{\partial^2 \bar u}{\partial \bar x^2},
        \quad   \bar x\in (0,1),\ \bar t\in (0, \bar T],
        
        

.. _Eq:scale:heat:pde3:ic:u:d:

.. math::
   :label: scale:heat:pde3:ic:u:d
          
        \bar u(\bar x,0) = 0,
        \quad  \bar x\in [0,1],
        
        

.. _Eq:scale:heat:pde3:bc:0:d:

.. math::
   :label: scale:heat:pde3:bc:0:d
          
        \bar u(0, \bar t)  = 1,
        \quad   \bar t\in (0, \bar T],
        
        

.. _Eq:scale:heat:pde3:bc:L:d:

.. math::
   :label: scale:heat:pde3:bc:L:d
          
        \frac{\partial}{\partial \bar x} u(1, \bar t)  = 0,
        \quad  \bar t\in (0, \bar T].
        
        

The striking feature is that there are no physical parameters left in
this problem. One simulation can be carried out for :math:`\bar u(\bar x,\bar t)`,
and the temperature in a rod of any material and any constant initial and
boundary temperature can be retrieved by

.. math::
         u(x,t) = U_0 + (U_1-U_0)\bar u(x/L, t{\alpha}/L^2){\thinspace .}

[**hpl 6**: Include simulation results.]

Oscillating Dirichlet condition
-------------------------------

Let us address the heat equation problem where the temperature is
oscillating on the boundary :math:`x=0`:

.. _Eq:scale:heat:pde2:

.. math::
   :label: scale:heat:pde2
        
        \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} =
        {\alpha} \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2},
        \quad   x\in (0,L),\ t\in (0, T],
        
        

.. _Eq:scale:heat:pde2:ic:u:

.. math::
   :label: scale:heat:pde2:ic:u
          
        u(x,0) = U_0,
        \quad  x\in [0,L],
        
        

.. _Eq:scale:heat:pde2:bc:0:

.. math::
   :label: scale:heat:pde2:bc:0
          
        u(0, t)  = U_0 + A\sin(\omega t),
        \quad   t\in (0, T],
        
        

.. _Eq:scale:heat:pde2:bc:L:

.. math::
   :label: scale:heat:pde2:bc:L
          
        \frac{\partial}{\partial x} u(L, t)  = 0,
        \quad  t\in (0, T].
        
        

One important physical application is temperature oscillations in the
ground, either day and night variations
at a short temporal and spatial scale, or seasonal variations in the
Earth's crust.

Since the boundary temperature is oscillating around the initial
condition, we expect :math:`u\in [-A,A]`.
Then the dimensionless temperature is therefore taken as

.. math::
         \bar u = \frac{u-U_0}{2A},

such that :math:`\bar u\in [-1,1]`.

What is an appropriate time scale? There will be two time scales involved,
the oscillations :math:`\sin(\omega t)` with period :math:`P=2\pi/\omega` at
the boundary and the "speed of diffusion" where :math:`t_c=L^2/{\alpha}` is
the appropriate scale.
Analytical insight exists in this model problem because the exact
solution is known to be

.. _Eq:scale:heat:daynight:sol:

.. math::
   :label: scale:heat:daynight:sol
        
        u(x,t) = U_0 - Ae^{-bx}\sin (bx - \omega t),\quad b =\sqrt{\frac{\omega}{2{\alpha}}}{\thinspace .}
        
        

This solution is of the form :math:`e^{-bx}g(x-ct)`, i.e., a wave that
moves to the right with velocity :math:`c` and a damped amplitude :math:`e^{-bx}`.
This is seen if we make a rewrite

.. math::
         u(x,t) = U_0 - Ae^{-bx}\sin\left(b(x - ct)\right),\quad
        c=\omega/b = \sqrt{2{\alpha}\omega},\  b =\sqrt{\frac{\omega}{2{\alpha}}}{\thinspace .}

The boundary oscillations lead to the time scale :math:`t_c=1/\omega`.
The speed of the wave suggests another time scale: the time it
takes to propagate through the domain, which is :math:`L/c`, and
hence :math:`t_c = L/c = L/\sqrt{2{\alpha}\omega}`.

One may argue that :math:`L` is not the appropriate length scale, because
:math:`u` is damped by :math:`e^{-bx}` so for :math:`x > 4/b`, :math:`u` is close to zero.
Using :math:`1/b` as length scale, which is the e-folding distance of the
damping factor, and basing
:math:`t_c` on the time it takes a signal to propagate one length scale,
:math:`t_c^{-1}=bc=\omega`. Similarly, the time scale based on
the "speed of diffusion" changes to
:math:`t_c^{-1}= b^2{\alpha} = \frac{1}{2}\omega` if we employ :math:`1/b` as length scale.

To summarize, we have three candidates for the time scale:
:math:`t_c=L^2/{\alpha}`, :math:`t_c=2/\omega`, and :math:`t_c=1/\omega`.

Let us look
at the dimensionless exact solution to see if it can help with the choice.
We introduce the dimensionless
parameters

.. math::
         \beta = bx_c = x_c\sqrt{\frac{\omega}{2dfc}},\quad
        \gamma = \omega t_c{\thinspace .}

The scaled solution becomes

.. math::
         \bar u(\bar x, \bar t; \beta,\gamma) = e^{-\beta\bar x}\sin(\beta\bar x - \gamma\bar t){\thinspace .}

The three choices of :math:`\gamma`, implied by the three choices of :math:`t_c`, are

.. _Eq:scale:heat:daynight:gamma3:

.. math::
   :label: scale:heat:daynight:gamma3
        
        \gamma = \left\lbrace\begin{array}{ll}
        1, & t_c=1/\omega,\\ 
        2, & t_c = 2/\omega,\\ 
        2\beta^2, & t_c = L^2/{\alpha},\ x_c=L
        \end{array}\right.
        
        

The former two choices leaves only :math:`\beta` as parameter in :math:`\bar u`,
and with :math:`x_c=1/b` as length scale, :math:`\beta` becomes unity, and there
are no parameters in the dimensionless solution:

.. _Eq:scale:heat:daynight:xcb:

.. math::
   :label: scale:heat:daynight:xcb
        
        \bar u(\bar x, \bar t) = e^{-\bar x}\sin(\bar x - \bar t){\thinspace .}
        
        

Therefore, :math:`x_c=1/b` and :math:`t_c=1/\omega` (or :math:`t_c=2/\omega`, but the
factor 2 is of no importance) are therefore the most appropriate scales.

To further argue why :eq:`scale:heat:daynight:xcb` these scales are
preferred, think of
:math:`\omega` as large. Then the wave is damped over a short
distance and there will be a thin boundary layer of temperature
oscillations near :math:`x=0` and little changes in :math:`u` in the rest of
the domain. The scaling :eq:`scale:heat:daynight:xcb` resolves
this problem by using :math:`1/b \sim \omega^{-1/2}` as length scale,
because then the boundary layer thickness is independent of
:math:`\omega`. The length of the domain can be chosen as, e.g., :math:`4/b`
such that :math:`\bar u\approx 0` at this end. The length scale :math:`1/b`
help us to zoom in on the part of :math:`u` where significant changes
take place.

In the other limit, :math:`\omega` small, :math:`b` becomes small, and the wave
is hardly damped in the domain :math:`[0,L]` unless :math:`L` is large enough.
The imposed boundary condition on :math:`x=L` in fact requires :math:`u` to
be constant so its derivative vanishes, and this property can only
be obtained if :math:`L` is
enough to ensure that the wave becomes significantly damped.
Therefore, the length scale is dictated by :math:`b`, not :math:`L`, and :math:`L`
should be adapted to :math:`b`, typically :math:`L\geq 4/b`.

The resulting scaled problem becomes

.. _Eq:scale:heat:pde2:d:

.. math::
   :label: scale:heat:pde2:d
        
        \frac{\partial \bar u}{\partial \bar t} =
        \frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2},
        \quad  \bar x\in (0,4/b),\ \bar t\in (0,\bar T],
        
        

.. _Eq:scale:heat:pde2:ic:u:d:

.. math::
   :label: scale:heat:pde2:ic:u:d
          
        \bar u(\bar x,0) = 0,
        \quad \bar x\in [0,1]
        
        

.. _Eq:scale:heat:pde2:bc:0:d:

.. math::
   :label: scale:heat:pde2:bc:0:d
          
        \bar u(0,\bar t)  = \sin(\bar t),
        \quad  \bar t\in (0,\bar T],
        
        

.. _Eq:scale:heat:pde2:bc:L:d:

.. math::
   :label: scale:heat:pde2:bc:L:d
          
        \frac{\partial}{\partial\bar x}\bar u(1,\bar t)  = 0,
        \quad \bar t\in (0,\bar T].
        
        

The coefficient in front of the second-derivative becomes

.. math::
         \frac{t_c{\alpha}}{1/b^2} = \frac{b^2{\alpha}}{\omega} =
        = \frac{1}{2}{\thinspace .}

We may, of course, choose :math:`t_c=2/\omega` and get rid of the :math:`\frac{1}{2}` factor,
if desired, but then it turns up in :eq:`scale:heat:pde2:bc:0:d` instead,
as :math:`\sin (2\bar t)`.

.. _sec:scale:diffu:source:

Diffusion equation with source term
-----------------------------------

Let us add a source term :math:`f(x,t)` to the diffusion equation,

.. _Eq:sec:scale:diffu:pde1f:

.. math::
   :label: sec:scale:diffu:pde1f
        
        \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} =
        {\alpha}\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + f(x,t), \quad  x\in (0,L),\ t\in (0,T]
        {\thinspace .}
        
        

As always, we introduce

.. math::
         \bar x = \frac{x}{x_c},\quad
        \ \bar t = \frac{t}{t_c}, \quad\bar u =\frac{u}{u_c},

and a scaling of :math:`f`,

.. math::
         \bar f(\bar x,\bar t) = \frac{f(x,t)}{f_c},\quad f_c=\max_{x,t}f(x,t){\thinspace .}

Inserting the dimensionless quantities in :eq:`sec:scale:diffu:pde1f`
and making each term dimensionless results in

.. _Eq:sec:scale:diffu:pde1f:nondim0:

.. math::
   :label: sec:scale:diffu:pde1f:nondim0
        
        \frac{\partial \bar u}{\partial \bar t} =
        \frac{t_c{\alpha}}{x_c^2}
        \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \frac{t_cf_c}{u_c}
        \bar f(\bar x,\bar t), \quad  \bar x\in (0,L/x_c),\ \bar t\in (0,T/t_c]
        {\thinspace .}
        
        

The magnitude of :math:`u` is governed by :math:`f` as well as by
initial and boundary conditions. Suppose initial and boundary conditions
are zero.
The length scale :math:`x_c` is naturally chosen as :math:`L` such that :math:`\bar x\in[0,1]`.
It is also natural to choose :math:`t_c` to be the time scale
of diffusion, as before, :math:`t_c=x_c^2/{\alpha} = L^2/{\alpha}`. The source term can match
the unit size of the two other terms by choosing its coefficient to be
unity, i.e.,

.. math::
         u_c=t_cf_c=\frac{L^2 \max_{x,t} f}{{\alpha}}{\thinspace .}

The scaled equation then becomes free of physical parameters:

.. _Eq:sec:scale:diffu:pde1f:nondim:

.. math::
   :label: sec:scale:diffu:pde1f:nondim
        
        \frac{\partial \bar u}{\partial \bar t} =
        \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} +
        \bar f(\bar x,\bar t), \quad  \bar x\in (0,L/x_c),\ \bar t\in (0,T/t_c]
        {\thinspace .}
        
        

With an initial condition :math:`u=I`, we get a scaled initial condition

.. math::
         \bar u(\bar x, 0) = \beta \bar I(L\bar x),

where :math:`\bar I = I/\max_x I(x)` is a scaled version of :math:`I`, and :math:`\beta`
is a dimensionless number

.. math::
         \beta = \frac{\max_xI(x)}{\max_{x,t}f(x,t)}\frac{{\alpha}}{L^2}{\thinspace .}

It measures the ratios of :math:`I` and :math:`f` per unit
characteristic time.

Suppose now that we choose :math:`u_c=\max_x I(x)` because :math:`f` is small compared
to :math:`I`. The initial condition then reads :math:`\bar u(\bar x,0)=\bar I(\bar x)`,
and the differential equation becomes

.. math::
        
        \frac{\partial \bar u}{\partial \bar t} =
        \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} +
        \beta^{-1} \bar f(\bar x,\bar t)
        {\thinspace .}
        

This is the relevant scaling for a small :math:`f` and large :math:`\beta`,
indicating that :math:`\beta^{-1} \bar f` can be neglected from the
PDE. A major influence of :math:`f` leads to a balance between all
three terms in the PDE, but the initial condition has a small
:math:`\beta`, and one can set :math:`\bar u(\bar x, 0)\approx 0`.
:ref:`scale:vib:exer:Couette_wpressure` explores a similar
stationary problem.

.. _sec:scale:diffu:Fisher:

Fisher's equation
-----------------

Fisher's equation is essentially the logistic equation at each point
for population dynamics combined with spatial movement through
ordinary diffusion:

.. _Eq:sec:scale:diffu:Fisher:pde:

.. math::
   :label: sec:scale:diffu:Fisher:pde
        
        \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} =
        {\alpha}\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \varrho u(1-u/M)
        {\thinspace .}
        
        

This PDE is also known as the KPP equation after
Kolmogorov, Petrovsky, and Piskynov (who introduced the equation
independently of Fisher).

Introducing

.. math::
         \bar x = \frac{x}{x_c},\quad
        \ \bar t = \frac{t}{t_c}, \quad\bar u =\frac{u}{u_c},

results in

.. math::
        
        \frac{\partial \bar u}{\partial \bar t} =
        \frac{t_c{\alpha}}{x_c^2}
        \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + t_c \varrho \bar u (1 - u_c\bar u/M){\thinspace .}
        

If all terms are equally important, the scales can be determined from
demanding the coefficients to be unity and by scaling :math:`u` by :math:`M`:

.. math::
         u_c=M,\quad t_c = \frac{1}{\varrho},\quad x_c = \sqrt{\frac{{\alpha}}{\varrho}}
        {\thinspace .}

The scaled PDE becomes

.. math::
        
        \frac{\partial \bar u}{\partial \bar t} =
        \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \bar u (1 - \bar u){\thinspace .}
        

With this scaling, the length scale :math:`x_c=\sqrt{{\alpha}/\varrho}`
is not related to the domain size, so the scale is most relevant for
an infinite domain. Also, note that the time scale :math:`t_c=\varrho^{-1}`
is governed by the logistic term (exponential growth for small :math:`u`)
and not the diffusion process as in most previous examples.

On a finite domain :math:`[0,L]` we set :math:`x_c=L`, :math:`t_c=\varrho^{-1}`,
:math:`u_c=M`, which gives

.. math::
        
        \frac{\partial \bar u}{\partial \bar t} =
        \beta
        \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \bar u (1 - \bar u),
        

where :math:`\beta` is a dimensionless number

.. math::
         \beta = \frac{{\alpha}}{\varrho L^2} = \frac{\varrho^{-1}}{L^2/{\alpha}},

demonstrating that :math:`\beta` measures the ratio of the time scale
for exponential growth in the beginning of the logistic process
and the time scale of diffusion :math:`L^2/{\alpha}`.
For small :math:`\beta` we can neglect the diffusion and spatial movements,
and the PDE is essentially a logistic ODE at each point, while for
large :math:`\beta`, diffusion dominates, and :math:`t_c` should in that case be
based on the diffusion time scale :math:`L^2/{\alpha}`. This leads to the
scaled PDE

.. math::
        
        \frac{\partial \bar u}{\partial \bar t} =
        \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \beta^{-1}\bar u (1 - \bar u),
        

showing that a large :math:`\beta` encourages omission of the logistic term,
because the point-wise growth takes place on large time scales while
diffusion is rapid. The effect of diffusion is then more prominent
and it suffices to solve :math:`\bar u_{\bar t} = \bar u_{\bar x\bar x}`.
