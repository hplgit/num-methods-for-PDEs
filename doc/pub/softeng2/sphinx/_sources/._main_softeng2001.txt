A 1D wave equation simulator
============================

Mathematical model
------------------

Let :math:`u_t`, :math:`u_{tt}`, :math:`u_x`, :math:`u_{xx}` denote derivatives of :math:`u` with
respect to the subscript, i.e., :math:`u_{tt}` is a second-order time
derivative and :math:`u_x` is a first-order space derivative.  The
initial-boundary value problem implemented in the ``wave1D_dn_vc.py``
code is

.. _Eq:wave:pde2:software:ueq:

.. math::
   :label: wave:pde2:software:ueq
        
        u_{tt} = (q(x)u_x)_x + f(x,t),\quad x\in (0,L),\ t\in (0,T]
        
        

.. math::
          
        u(x,0) = I(x),\quad x\in [0,L]
        

.. math::
          
        u_t(x,0) = V(t),\quad x\in [0,L]
        

.. math::
          
        u(0,t) = U_0(t)\hbox{ or } u_x(0,t)=0,\quad t\in (0,T]
        

.. _Eq:wave:pde2:software:bcL:

.. math::
   :label: wave:pde2:software:bcL
          
        u(L,t) = U_L(t)\hbox{ or } u_x(L,t)=0,\quad t\in (0,T]
        
        

We allow variable wave velocity :math:`c^2(x)=q(x)`, and Dirichlet or homogeneous
Neumann conditions at the boundaries.

Numerical discretization
------------------------

The PDE is discretized by second-order finite differences in
time and space, with arithmetic mean for the variable coefficient

.. math::
        
        [D_tD_t u = \varrho^{-1}D_x\overline{q}^xD_x u + f]^n_i
        {\thinspace .}
        

The Neumann boundary conditions are discretized by

.. math::
         [D_{2x}u]^n_i=0,

at a boundary point :math:`i`. The details of how the numerical scheme
is worked out are described in in
the document `Finite difference methods for wave motion <http://tinyurl.com/k3sdbuv/pub/wave>`__
[Ref1]_.

A solver function
-----------------

The general initial-boundary value problem
:eq:`wave:pde2:software:ueq`-:eq:`wave:pde2:software:bcL`
solved by finite difference methods can be implemented in
the following ``solver`` function (taken from the
file `wave1D_dn_vc.py <http://tinyurl.com/nm5587k/wave/wave1D/wave_dn_vc.py>`__).
This function builds on
simpler versions described in
in
the document `Finite difference methods for wave motion <http://tinyurl.com/k3sdbuv/pub/wave>`__
[Ref1]_.
There are several quite advanced
constructs that will be commented upon later.

Saving large arrays in files
============================

Numerical simulations produce large arrays as results and the software
needs to store these arrays on disk. Several methods are available
in Python. We recommend to use tailored solutions for large arrays and
not standard file storage tools such as ``pickle`` (``cPickle`` for speed
in Python version 2) and ``shelve``.

.. _softeng2:wave1D:filestorage:savez:

Using ``savez`` to store arrays in files
----------------------------------------

Storing individual arrays
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``numpy.storez`` function can store a set of arrays to a named
file in a zip archive. An associated function
``numpy.load`` can be used to read the file later.
Basically, we call ``numpy.storez(filename, **kwargs)``, where
``kwargs`` is a dictionary containing array names as keys and
the corresponding array objects as values. Very often, the
solution at a time point is given a natural name where the
name of the variable and the time level counter are combined, e.g.,
``u11`` or ``v39``. Suppose ``n`` is the time level counter and we have
two solution arrays, ``u`` and ``v``, that we want to save to a zip
archive. The appropriate code is

.. code-block:: python

        import numpy as np
        u_name = 'u%04d' % n   # array name
        v_name = 'v%04d' % n   # array name
        kwargs = {u_name: u, v_name: v}   # keyword args for savez
        fname = '.mydata%04d.dat' % n
        np.savez(fname, **kwargs)
        if n == 0:           # store x once
            np.savez('.mydata_x.dat', x=x)

Since the name of the array must be given as a keyword argument
to ``savez``, and the name must be constructed as shown, it becomes
a little tricky to do the call, but with a dictionary ``kwargs`` and
``**kwargs``, which sends each key-value pair as individual keyword
arguments, the task gets accomplished.

Merging zip archives
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each separate call to ``np.savez`` creates a new file (zip archive) with
extension ``.npz``. It is very convenient if collect all results in
one archive instead. This can be done by merging all the individual
``.npz`` files into a single zip archive:

.. code-block:: python

        def merge_zip_archives(individual_archives, archive_name):
            """
            Merge individual zip archives made with numpy.savez into
            one archive with name archive_name.
            The individual archives can be given as a list of names
            or as a Unix wild chard filename expression for glob.glob.
            The result of this function is that all the individual
            archives are deleted and the new single archive made.
            """
            import zipfile
            archive = zipfile.ZipFile(
                archive_name, 'w', zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED,
                allowZip64=True)
            if isinstance(individual_archives, (list,tuple)):
                filenames = individual_archives
            elif isinstance(individual_archives, str):
                filenames = glob.glob(individual_archives)
        
            # Open each archive and write to the common archive
            for filename in filenames:
                f = zipfile.ZipFile(filename,  'r',
                                    zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED)
                for name in f.namelist():
                    data = f.open(name, 'r')
                    # Save under name without .npy
                    archive.writestr(name[:-4], data.read())
                f.close()
                os.remove(filename)
            archive.close()

Here we remark that ``savez`` automatically
adds the ``.npz`` extension to the names of
the arrays we store. We do not want this extension in the final
archive.

Reading arrays from zip archives
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Archives created by ``savez`` or the merged archive we describe
above with name of the form ``myarchive.npz``
can be conveniently read by the ``numpy.load`` function:

.. code-block:: python

        import numpy as np
        array_names = np.load(`myarchive.npz`)
        for array_name in array_names:
            # array_names[array_name] is the array itself
            # e.g. plot(array_names['t'], array_names[array_name])

.. _softeng2:wave1D:filestorage:joblib:

Using ``joblib`` to store arrays in files
-----------------------------------------

The Python package ``joblib`` has nice functionality for efficient storage
of arrays on disk. The following class applies this functionality so that
one can save an array, or in fact any Python data structure (e.g., a
dictionary of arrays), to disk under a certain name. Later, we can
retrieve the object from its name. The name of the directory under which
the arrays are stored by ``joblib`` can be given by the user.

.. code-block:: python

The ``retrive`` and ``save`` functions, which do the work, seem quite
magic. The idea is that ``joblib`` looks at the ``name`` parameter
and saves the return value ``data`` to disk if the ``name`` parameter
has not been used in a previous call. Otherwise, if ``name`` is
already registered, ``joblib`` fetches the ``data`` object from
file and returns it (this is example of a memoize function,
see the document `Scaling of differential equations <http://tinyurl.com/k3sdbuv/pub/scale>`__ [Ref2]_ for a brief explanation).

.. _softeng2:wave1D:filestorage:hashlib:

Using a hash to create a file or directory name
-----------------------------------------------

The user of array storage techniques like those outlined in
the sections :ref:`softeng2:wave1D:filestorage:joblib` and
:ref:`softeng2:wave1D:filestorage:savez` demand the user to assign
a name for the file(s) or directory where the solution is to be
stored. Ideally, this name should reflect parameters in the problem
such that one can recognize an already run simulation. One
technique is to make a hash string out of the input data.
A hash string is a 40-character long hexadecimal string that uniquely
reflects another potentially much longer string. (You may be used
to hash strings from the Git version control system: every committed
version of the files in Git is recognized by a hash string.)

Suppose you have some input data in the form of functions,
``numpy`` arrays, and other objects. To turn these input data
into a string we may grab the source code of the functions,
use a very efficient hash method for potentially large arrays,
and simply convert all other objects via ``str`` to a string
representation. The final string, merging all input data,
is then converted to an SHA1 hash string such that we represent
the input with a 40-character long string.

.. code-block:: python

        def myfunction(func1, func2, array1, array2, obj1, obj2):
            # Convert arguments to hash
            import inspect, joblib, hashlib
            data = (inspect.getsource(func1),
                    inspect.getsource(func2),
        	    joblib.hash(array1),
        	    joblib.hash(array2),
        	    str(obj1),
        	    str(obj2))
            hash_input = hashlib.sha1(data).hexdigest()

It is wise to use ``joblib.hash`` and not try to do a
``str(array1)``, since that string can be *very* long, and
``joblib.hash`` is more efficient than ``hashlib`` to turn
these data into a hash.


.. admonition:: Remark: turning function objects into their source code is unreliable

   The idea of turning a function object into a string via its source code
   may look smart, but is not a completely reliable solution.
   Suppose we have some function
   
   .. code-block:: python
   
           x0 = 0.1
           f = lambda x: 0 of x <= x0 else 1
   
   The source code will be ``f = lambda x: 0 of x <= x0 else 1``, so if the
   calling code changes the value of ``x0`` (which ``f`` remembers - it is
   a closure), the source remains unchanged, the hash is the same,
   and the change in input data is unnoticed. Consequently, the technique
   above must be used with care. The user can always just remove the
   stored files in disk and thereby force a recomputation (provided the software
   applies to hash to test if a zip archive or ``joblib`` subdirectory
   exists and if so avoids recomputation).




Software for the 1D wave equation
=================================

.. -----------

We use ``numpy.storez`` to store the solution at each time level on disk.
Such actions must be
taken care of outside the ``solver`` function, more precisely in the
``user_action`` function that is called at every time level.

We have in the `wave1D_dn_vc.py <http://tinyurl.com/nm5587k/wave/wave1D/wave_dn_vc.py>`__
code implemented the ``user_action``
callback function as a class ``PlotAndStoreSolution`` with a
``__call__(self, x, t, t, n)`` method for the ``user_action`` function.
Basically, ``__call__`` stores and plots the solution.
The storage makes use of the ``numpy.savez`` function for saving
a set of arrays to a zip archive.
Here, in this callback function, we want to save one array, ``u``.
Since there will be many such arrays, we introduce the array names
``'u%04d' % n`` and closely related filenames.
The usage of ``numpy.savez`` in ``__call__`` goes like this:

.. code-block:: python

        from numpy import savez
        name = 'u%04d' % n   # array name
        kwargs = {name: u}   # keyword args for savez
        fname = '.' + self.filename + '_' + name + '.dat'
        self.t.append(t[n])  # store corresponding time value
        savez(fname, **kwargs)
        if n == 0:           # store x once
            savez('.' + self.filename + '_x.dat', x=x)

For example, if ``n`` is 10 and ``self.filename`` is ``tmp``,
the above call to ``savez`` becomes
``savez('.tmp_u0010.dat', u0010=u)``.
The actual filename becomes ``.tmp_u0010.dat.npz``. The actual array
name becomes ``u0010.npy``.

Each ``savez`` call results in a file, so after the simulation we have
one file per time level. Each file produced by ``savez`` is a zip archive.
It makes sense to merge all the files into one. This is done in
the ``close_file`` method in the ``PlotAndStoreSolution`` class. The code goes as
follows.

.. code-block:: python

        class PlotAndStoreSolution:
            ...
            def close_file(self, hashed_input):
                """
                Merge all files from savez calls into one archive.
                hashed_input is a string reflecting input data
                for this simulation (made by solver).
                """
                if self.filename is not None:
                    # Save all the time points where solutions are saved
                    savez('.' + self.filename + '_t.dat',
                          t=array(self.t, dtype=float))
                    # Merge all savez files to one zip archive
                    archive_name = '.' + hashed_input + '_archive.npz'
                    filenames = glob.glob('.' + self.filename + '*.dat.npz')
                    merge_zip_archives(filenames, archive_name)

We use various ``ZipFile`` functionality to extract the content of the
individual files (each with name ``filename``) and write it to the
merged archive (``archive``).  There is only one
array in each individual file (``filename``) so strictly speaking, there
is no need for the loop ``for name in f.namelist()`` (as ``f.namelist()``
returns a list of length 1). However, in other applications where
we compute more arrays at each time level, ``savez`` will store all
these and then there is need for iterating over ``f.namelist()``.

Instead of merging the archives written by ``savez`` we could make
an alternative implementation that writes all our arrays into
one archive. This is the subject of :ref:`softeng2:exer:savez`.

.. _softeng2:wave1D:filestorage:hashlib:

Making hash strings from input data
-----------------------------------

The ``hashed_input`` argument, used to name the
resulting archive file with all solutions, is supposed to be a
hash reflecting all import parameters in the problem such that this
simulation has a unique name.
The ``hashed_input`` string is made in the `solver <http://tinyurl.com/nm5587k/wave/wave1D/wave_dn_vc.py>`__ function, using the ``hashlib``
and ``inspect`` modules, based on the arguments to ``solver``:

.. code-block:: python

        # Make hash of all input data
        import hashlib, inspect
        data = inspect.getsource(I) + '_' + inspect.getsource(V) + \ 
               '_' + inspect.getsource(f) + '_' + str(c) + '_' + \ 
               ('None' if U_0 is None else inspect.getsource(U_0)) + \ 
               ('None' if U_L is None else inspect.getsource(U_L)) + \ 
               '_' + str(L) + str(dt) + '_' + str(C) + '_' + str(T) + \ 
               '_' + str(stability_safety_factor)
        hashed_input = hashlib.sha1(data).hexdigest()

NOTE: All this is now explained!

To get the source code of a function ``f`` as a string,
we use ``inspect.getsource(f)``. All input, functions as
well as variables, is then merged
to a string ``data``, and then ``hashlib.sha1`` makes a unique, much shorter
(40 characters long),
fixed-length string out of ``data`` that we can use in the archive filename.


.. admonition:: Remark

   Note that the construction of the ``data`` string is not fool proof:
   if, e.g., ``I`` is a formula with parameters and the parameters change,
   the source code is still the same and ``data`` and hence the hash remains
   unaltered. The implementation must therefore be used with care!




.. _softeng2:wave1D:filestorage:hashlib:

Avoiding rerunning previously run cases
---------------------------------------

If the archive file whose name is based on ``hashed_input`` already
exists, the simulation with the current set of parameters has been
done before and one can avoid redoing the work. The ``solver`` function
returns the CPU time and ``hashed_input``, and a negative CPU time means
that no simulation was run. In that case we should not call
the ``close_file`` method above (otherwise we overwrite the archive with
just the ``self.t`` array). The typical usage goes like

.. code-block:: python

        action = PlotAndStoreSolution(...)
        dt = (L/Nx)/C  # choose the stability limit with given Nx
        cpu, hashed_input = solver(
            I=lambda x: ...,
            V=0, f=0, c=1, U_0=lambda t: 0, U_L=None, L=1,
            dt=dt, C=C, T=T,
            user_action=action, version='vectorized',
            stability_safety_factor=1)
        action.make_movie_file()
        if cpu > 0:  # did we generate new data?
            action.close_file(hashed_input)

Verification
------------

Exact solutions of the numerical equations are always attractive for
verification purposes since the software should reproduce such
solutions to machine precision. With Dirichlet boundary conditions
we can construct a function that is linear in :math:`t` and quadratic in
:math:`x` that is an exact solution of the scheme, while with Neumann
conditions are left with testing just a constant solution
(see comments in in
the document `Finite difference methods for wave motion <http://tinyurl.com/k3sdbuv/pub/wave>`__
[Ref1]_).

A more general method for verification is to check the convergence rates.

Do convergence rates here! It is general...

Programming the solver with classes
===================================

Many who knows about class programming prefer to organize their software
in terms of classes. We can easily port our function-based code in ...
to a class version.

We will create a class ``Problem`` to hold the physical parameters of the
problem and a class ``Solver`` to hold the numerical parameters and
the solver function. In addition, it is convenient to collect the
arrays that describe the mesh in a special ``Mesh`` class and make
a class ``Function`` for a mesh function (mesh point values and its mesh).

Class Problem
-------------

Class Mesh
----------

The ``Mesh`` class can be made valid for a space-time mesh in any number
of space dimensions. To make versatile, the constructor accepts
either a tuple/list of number of cells in each spatial dimension or
a tuple/list of cell spacings. In addition, we need the size of the
hypercube mesh as a tuple/list of 2-tuples with lower and upper limits
of the mesh coordinates in each direction. For 1D meshes it is more
natural to just write the number of cells or the cell size and not
wrap it in a list. We also need the time
interval from ``t0`` to ``T``. Giving no spatial discretization information
implies a time mesh only, and vice versa. The ``Mesh`` class with
documentation and a doc test should now be self-explanatory:

.. code-block:: python

        import numpy as np
        
        class Mesh(object):
            """
            Holds data structures for a uniform mesh on a hypercube in
            space, plus a uniform mesh in time.
        
            ======== ==================================================
            Argument                Explanation
            ======== ==================================================

                     in each spatial direction.
            T        Final time in time mesh.
            Nt       Number of cells in time mesh.
            dt       Time step. Either Nt or dt must be given.
            N        List of number of cells in the spatial directions.
            d        List of cell sizes in the spatial directions.
                     Either N or d must be given.
            ======== ==================================================
        
            Users can access all the parameters mentioned above, plus
            ``x[i]`` and ``t`` for the coordinates in direction ``i``
            and the time coordinates, respectively.

.. admonition:: We rely on attribute access - not get/set functions

   Java programmers in particular are used to get/set functions in
   classes to access internal data. In Python, we usually apply direct
   access of the attribute, such as ``m.N[i]`` if ``m`` is a ``Mesh`` object.
   A widely used convention is to do this as long as access to
   an attribute does not require additional code. In that case, one
   applies a property construction. The original interface remains
   the same after a property is introduced (in contrast to Java), so
   user will not notice a change to properties.
   
   The only argument against direct attribute access in class ``Mesh``
   is that the attributes are read-only so we could avoid offering
   a set function. Instead, we rely on the user that she does not
   assign new values to the attributes.




Class Function
--------------

A class ``Function`` is handy to hold a mesh and corresponding values for
a scalar or vector function over the mesh. Since we may have a
time or space mesh, or a combined time and space mesh, with one or
more components in the function, some if tests are needed for
allocating the right array sizes. To help the user, an ``indices``
attribute with the name of the indices in the final array ``u``
for the function values is made. The examples in the doc string
should explain the functionality.

.. code-block:: python

        class Function(object):
            """
            A scalar or vector function over a mesh (of class Mesh).

Migrating loops to Cython
=========================

.. index:: Cython

We now consider the `wave2D_u0.py <http://tinyurl.com/nm5587k/wave/wave2D_u0/wave2D_u0.py>`__
code for solving the 2D linear wave equation with constant wave
velocity and homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions :math:`u=0`.
This code contains a ``solver`` function, which calls and ``advance_*``
function to advance the numerical scheme one level forward in time.
The function ``advance_scalar`` applies standard Python loops to implement
the scheme, while ``advance_vectorized`` performs corresponding
vectorized arithmetics with array slices. The statements of this
solver are explained in
in
the document `Finite difference methods for wave motion <http://tinyurl.com/k3sdbuv/pub/wave>`__
[Ref1]_.

Although vectorization can bring down the CPU time dramatically
compared with scalar code, there is still some factor 5-10 to win
in these types of applications
by implementing the finite difference scheme in compiled code,
typically in Fortran, C, or C++. This can quite easily be done by
adding a little extra code to our program. Cython is an extension of
Python that offers the easiest way to nail our Python loops in the
scalar code down to machine code and achieve the efficiency of C.

Cython can be viewed as an extended Python language where variables are
declared with types and where functions are marked to be implemented in C.
Migrating Python code to Cython is done by copying the desired code
segments to functions (or classes) and placing them in one or more separate
files with extension ``.pyx``.

Declaring variables and annotating the code
-------------------------------------------

Our starting point is the plain ``advance_scalar`` function for a scalar
implementation of the updating algorithm for new values
:math:`u^{n+1}_{i,j}`:

.. code-block:: python

        def advance_scalar(u, u_1, u_2, f, x, y, t, n, Cx2, Cy2, dt2,
                           V=None, step1=False):
            Ix = range(0, u.shape[0]);  Iy = range(0, u.shape[1])
            if step1:
                dt = sqrt(dt2)  # save
                Cx2 = 0.5*Cx2;  Cy2 = 0.5*Cy2; dt2 = 0.5*dt2  # redefine
                D1 = 1;  D2 = 0
            else:
                D1 = 2;  D2 = 1
            for i in Ix[1:-1]:
                for j in Iy[1:-1]:
                    u_xx = u_1[i-1,j] - 2*u_1[i,j] + u_1[i+1,j]
                    u_yy = u_1[i,j-1] - 2*u_1[i,j] + u_1[i,j+1]
                    u[i,j] = D1*u_1[i,j] - D2*u_2[i,j] + \ 
                             Cx2*u_xx + Cy2*u_yy + dt2*f(x[i], y[j], t[n])
                    if step1:
                        u[i,j] += dt*V(x[i], y[j])
            # Boundary condition u=0
            j = Iy[0]
            for i in Ix: u[i,j] = 0
            j = Iy[-1]
            for i in Ix: u[i,j] = 0
            i = Ix[0]
            for j in Iy: u[i,j] = 0
            i = Ix[-1]
            for j in Iy: u[i,j] = 0
            return u

We simply take
a copy of this function and put it in a file ``wave2D_u0_loop_cy.pyx``.
The relevant Cython implementation arises from declaring variables with
types and adding some important annotations to speed up array
computing in Cython. Let us first list the complete code in the
``.pyx`` file:

.. code-block:: cython

        import numpy as np
        cimport numpy as np
        cimport cython
        ctypedef np.float64_t DT    # data type
        
        @cython.boundscheck(False)  # turn off array bounds check
        @cython.wraparound(False)   # turn off negative indices (u[-1,-1])
        cpdef advance(
            np.ndarray[DT, ndim=2, mode='c'] u,
            np.ndarray[DT, ndim=2, mode='c'] u_1,
            np.ndarray[DT, ndim=2, mode='c'] u_2,
            np.ndarray[DT, ndim=2, mode='c'] f,
            double Cx2, double Cy2, double dt2):
        
            cdef:
                int Ix_start = 0
                int Iy_start = 0
                int Ix_end = u.shape[0]-1
                int Iy_end = u.shape[1]-1
                int i, j
                double u_xx, u_yy
        
            for i in range(Ix_start+1, Ix_end):
                for j in range(Iy_start+1, Iy_end):
                    u_xx = u_1[i-1,j] - 2*u_1[i,j] + u_1[i+1,j]
                    u_yy = u_1[i,j-1] - 2*u_1[i,j] + u_1[i,j+1]
                    u[i,j] = 2*u_1[i,j] - u_2[i,j] + \
                             Cx2*u_xx + Cy2*u_yy + dt2*f[i,j]
            # Boundary condition u=0
            j = Iy_start
            for i in range(Ix_start, Ix_end+1): u[i,j] = 0
            j = Iy_end
            for i in range(Ix_start, Ix_end+1): u[i,j] = 0
            i = Ix_start
            for j in range(Iy_start, Iy_end+1): u[i,j] = 0
            i = Ix_end
            for j in range(Iy_start, Iy_end+1): u[i,j] = 0
            return u

.. index:: declaration of variables in Cython

This example may act as a recipe on how to transform array-intensive
code with loops into Cython.

1. Variables are declared with types: for example,
   ``double v`` in the argument list instead of just ``v``, and ``cdef double v``
   for a variable ``v`` in the body of the function.
   A Python ``float`` object is declared as ``double`` for
   translation to C by Cython, while an ``int`` object is
   declared by ``int``.

2. Arrays need a comprehensive type declaration involving

   * the type ``np.ndarray``,

   * the data type of the elements, here 64-bit floats,
     abbreviated as ``DT`` through ``ctypedef np.float64_t DT``
     (instead of ``DT`` we could use the full name of the
     data type: ``np.float64_t``, which is a Cython-defined type),

   * the dimensions of the array, here ``ndim=2`` and ``ndim=1``,

   * specification of contiguous memory for the array (``mode='c'``).

3. Functions declared with ``cpdef`` are translated to C but are also
   accessible from Python.

4. In addition to the standard ``numpy`` import we also need a special
   Cython import of ``numpy``: ``cimport numpy as np``, to appear *after*
   the standard import.

5. By default, array indices are checked to be within their legal
   limits. To speed up the code one should turn off this feature
   for a specific function by placing ``@cython.boundscheck(False)``
   above the function header.

6. Also by default, array indices can be negative (counting from the
   end), but this feature has a performance penalty and is therefore
   here turned off by writing ``@cython.wraparound(False)`` right above
   the function header.

7. The use of index sets ``Ix`` and ``Iy`` in the scalar code cannot be
   successfully translated to C. One reason is that constructions like
   ``Ix[1:-1]`` involve negative indices, and these are now turned
   off. Another reason is that Cython loops must take the form ``for i
   in xrange`` or ``for i in range`` for being translated into efficient
   C loops. We have therefore introduced ``Ix_start`` as ``Ix[0]``
   and ``Ix_end`` as ``Ix[-1]`` to hold the start and end of the values
   of index :math:`i`. Similar variables are introduced for the :math:`j` index.
   A loop ``for i in Ix`` is with these new variables written as
   ``for i in range(Ix_start, Ix_end+1)``.


.. admonition:: Array declaration syntax in Cython

   We have used the syntax ``np.ndarray[DT, ndim=2, mode='c']`` to declare
   ``numpy`` arrays in Cython. There is a simpler, alternative syntax, employing
   `typed memory views <http://docs.cython.org/src/userguide/memoryviews.html>`__,
   where the declaration looks like ``double [:,:]``.
   However, the full support for this functionality is not yet ready, and
   in this text we use the full array declaration syntax.




Visual inspection of the C translation
--------------------------------------

.. index:: cython -a (Python-C translation in HTML)

Cython can visually explain how successfully it translated a code from
Python to C. The command

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> cython -a wave2D_u0_loop_cy.pyx

produces an HTML file ``wave2D_u0_loop_cy.html``, which can be loaded into
a web browser to illustrate which lines of the code that have been
translated to C. Figure :ref:`wave:2D3D:impl:fig:cython:ma1` shows
the illustrated code. Yellow lines indicate the lines that Cython did not manage
to translate to efficient C code and that remain in Python.
For the present code we see that Cython is able to translate all the
loops with array computing to C, which is our primary goal.

.. _wave:2D3D:impl:fig:cython:ma1:

.. figure:: wave2D_u0_loop_cy1.png
   :width: 500

   *Visual illustration of Cython's ability to translate Python to C*

You can also inspect the generated C code directly, as it appears in
the file ``wave2D_u0_loop_cy.c``. Nevertheless, understanding this C
code requires some familiarity with writing Python extension modules
in C by hand.  Deep down in the file we can see in detail how the
compute-intensive statements have been translated into some complex C
code that is quite different from what a human would write (at
least if a direct correspondence to the mathematical notation was
intended).

Building the extension module  (1)
----------------------------------

.. index:: C extension module

.. index:: setup.py

.. index:: distutils

Cython code must be translated to C, compiled, and linked to form what
is known in the Python world as a *C extension module*.
This is usually done by making a ``setup.py`` script, which
is the standard way of building and installing Python software.
For an extension module arising from Cython code, the following
``setup.py`` script is all we need to build and install the module:

.. code-block:: python

        from distutils.core import setup
        from distutils.extension import Extension
        from Cython.Distutils import build_ext
        
        cymodule = 'wave2D_u0_loop_cy'
        setup(
          name=cymodule
          ext_modules=[Extension(cymodule, [cymodule + '.pyx'],)],
          cmdclass={'build_ext': build_ext},
        )

We run the script by

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> python setup.py build_ext --inplace

The ``--inplace`` option makes the extension module available in the
current directory as the file ``wave2D_u0_loop_cy.so``. This
file acts as a normal Python module that can be imported and inspected:

.. code-block:: ipy

        >>> import wave2D_u0_loop_cy
        >>> dir(wave2D_u0_loop_cy)
        ['__builtins__', '__doc__', '__file__', '__name__',
         '__package__', '__test__', 'advance', 'np']

The important output from the ``dir`` function is our Cython function
``advance`` (the module also features the imported ``numpy`` module under
the name ``np`` as well as many standard Python objects with double
underscores in their names).

The ``setup.py`` file makes use of the ``distutils`` package in Python
and Cython's extension of this package.
These tools know how Python was built on the computer and will
use compatible compiler(s) and options when building other code
in Cython, C, or C++. Quite some experience with building large
program systems is needed to do the build process manually, so using
a ``setup.py`` script is strongly recommended.


.. admonition:: Simplified build of a Cython module

   When there is no need to link the C code with special libraries,
   Cython offers a shortcut for generating and importing the extension
   module:
   
   .. code-block:: python
   
           import pyximport; pyximport.install()
   
   This makes the ``setup.py`` script redundant. However, in the ``wave2D_u0.py``
   code we do not use ``pyximport`` and require an explicit build process
   of this and many other modules.




Calling the Cython function from Python
---------------------------------------

The ``wave2D_u0_loop_cy``
module contains our ``advance`` function, which we now may call from
the Python program for the wave equation:

.. code-block:: python

        import wave2D_u0_loop_cy
        advance = wave2D_u0_loop_cy.advance
        ...
        for n in It[1:-1:                  # time loop
            f_a[:,:] = f(xv, yv, t[n])     # precompute, size as u
            u = advance(u, u_1, u_2, f_a, x, y, t, Cx2, Cy2, dt2)

Efficiency  (1)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For a mesh consisting of :math:`120\times 120` cells, the scalar Python code
require 1370 CPU time units, the vectorized version requires 5.5,
while the Cython version requires only 1! For a smaller mesh with
:math:`60\times 60` cells Cython is about 1000 times faster than the scalar
Python code, and the vectorized version is about 6 times slower than
the Cython version.

.. In 3D these numbers are even more favorable.

Migrating loops to Fortran
==========================

Instead of relying on Cython's (excellent) ability to translate Python to C,
we can invoke a compiled language directly and write the loops ourselves.
Let us start with Fortran 77, because this is a language with more
convenient array handling than C (or plain C++). Or more precisely,
we can with ease program with the same multi-dimensional indices
in the Fortran code as in the ``numpy``
arrays in the Python code, while in C these arrays are
one-dimensional and requires us to reduce multi-dimensional indices
to a single index.

.. Fortran compilers

.. build on 60 years of intensive research on how to optimize loops with

.. array computations.

The Fortran subroutine
----------------------

.. index:: wrapper code

.. index:: Fortran subroutine

We write a Fortran subroutine ``advance`` in a file
`wave2D_u0_loop_f77.f <http://tinyurl.com/nm5587k/wave/wave2D_u0/wave2D_u0_loop_f77.f>`__
for implementing the updating formula
(:ref:`wave:2D3D:impl1:2Du0:ueq:discrete`) and setting the solution to zero
at the boundaries:

.. code-block:: fortran

              subroutine advance(u, u_1, u_2, f, Cx2, Cy2, dt2, Nx, Ny)
              integer Nx, Ny
              real*8 u(0:Nx,0:Ny), u_1(0:Nx,0:Ny), u_2(0:Nx,0:Ny)
              real*8 f(0:Nx,0:Ny), Cx2, Cy2, dt2
              integer i, j
              real*8 u_xx, u_yy
        Cf2py intent(in, out) u
        
        C     Scheme at interior points
              do j = 1, Ny-1
                 do i = 1, Nx-1
                    u_xx = u_1(i-1,j) - 2*u_1(i,j) + u_1(i+1,j)
                    u_yy = u_1(i,j-1) - 2*u_1(i,j) + u_1(i,j+1)
                    u(i,j) = 2*u_1(i,j) - u_2(i,j) + Cx2*u_xx + Cy2*u_yy +
             &               dt2*f(i,j)
                 end do
              end do
        
        C     Boundary conditions
              j = 0
              do i = 0, Nx
                 u(i,j) = 0
              end do
              j = Ny
              do i = 0, Nx
                 u(i,j) = 0
              end do
              i = 0
              do j = 0, Ny
                 u(i,j) = 0
              end do
              i = Nx
              do j = 0, Ny
                 u(i,j) = 0
              end do
              return
              end

This code is plain Fortran 77, except for the special ``Cf2py`` comment
line, which here specifies that ``u`` is both an input argument *and*
an object to be returned from the ``advance`` routine. Or more
precisely, Fortran is not able return an array from a function,
but we need a *wrapper code* in C for the Fortran subroutine to enable
calling it from Python, and from this wrapper code one can return ``u``
to the calling Python code.


.. admonition:: Remark

   It is not strictly necessary to return ``u`` to the calling Python
   code since the ``advance`` function will modify the elements of ``u``,
   but the convention in Python is to get all output from a function
   as returned values. That is, the right way of calling the above
   Fortran subroutine from Python is
   
   .. code-block:: python
   
           u = advance(u, u_1, u_2, f, Cx2, Cy2, dt2)
   
   The less encouraged style, which works and resembles the way the
   Fortran subroutine is called from Fortran, reads
   
   .. code-block:: python
   
           advance(u, u_1, u_2, f, Cx2, Cy2, dt2)




Building the Fortran module with f2py
-------------------------------------

The nice feature of writing loops in Fortran is that, without
much effort, the tool ``f2py``
can produce a C extension module such that
we can call the Fortran version of ``advance`` from Python.
The necessary commands to run are

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> f2py -m wave2D_u0_loop_f77 -h wave2D_u0_loop_f77.pyf \ 
                  --overwrite-signature wave2D_u0_loop_f77.f
        Terminal> f2py -c wave2D_u0_loop_f77.pyf --build-dir build_f77 \ 
                  -DF2PY_REPORT_ON_ARRAY_COPY=1 wave2D_u0_loop_f77.f

The first command asks ``f2py`` to interpret the Fortran code and make
a Fortran 90
specification of the extension module in the file
``wave2D_u0_loop_f77.pyf``. The second command makes
``f2py`` generate all necessary
wrapper code, compile our Fortran file and the wrapper code,
and finally build the module.
The build process takes place in the specified subdirectory ``build_f77``
so that files can be inspected if something goes wrong.
The option ``-DF2PY_REPORT_ON_ARRAY_COPY=1`` makes ``f2py`` write a message
for every array that is copied in the communication between Fortran and Python,
which is very useful for avoiding unnecessary array copying (see below).
The name of the module file
is ``wave2D_u0_loop_f77.so``, and this file can be imported and inspected
as any other
Python module:

.. code-block:: ipy

        >>> import wave2D_u0_loop_f77
        >>> dir(wave2D_u0_loop_f77)
        ['__doc__', '__file__', '__name__', '__package__',
         '__version__', 'advance']
        >>> print wave2D_u0_loop_f77.__doc__
        This module 'wave2D_u0_loop_f77' is auto-generated with f2py....
        Functions:
          u = advance(u,u_1,u_2,f,cx2,cy2,dt2,
              nx=(shape(u,0)-1),ny=(shape(u,1)-1))


.. admonition:: Examine the doc strings

   Printing the doc strings of the module and its functions is
   extremely important after having created a module with ``f2py``.
   The reason is that
   ``f2py`` makes Python interfaces to the Fortran functions
   that are different from how the functions are declared in
   the Fortran code (!). The rationale for this behavior is that
   ``f2py`` creates *Pythonic* interfaces such that Fortran routines
   can be called in the same way as one calls Python functions.
   Output data from Python functions is always returned
   to the calling code, but this is technically impossible in Fortran.
   Also, arrays in Python are passed to Python functions without
   their dimensions because that information is packed with the array
   data in the array objects. This is not possible in Fortran, however.
   Therefore, ``f2py`` removes array dimensions from the argument list,
   and ``f2py`` makes it possible to
   return objects back to Python.




Let us follow the advice of examining the doc strings
and take a close look at
the documentation ``f2py`` has generated for our Fortran ``advance``
subroutine:

.. code-block:: ipy

        >>> print wave2D_u0_loop_f77.advance.__doc__
        This module 'wave2D_u0_loop_f77' is auto-generated with f2py
        Functions:
          u = advance(u,u_1,u_2,f,cx2,cy2,dt2,
                      nx=(shape(u,0)-1),ny=(shape(u,1)-1))
        .
        advance - Function signature:
          u = advance(u,u_1,u_2,f,cx2,cy2,dt2,[nx,ny])
        Required arguments:
          u : input rank-2 array('d') with bounds (nx + 1,ny + 1)
          u_1 : input rank-2 array('d') with bounds (nx + 1,ny + 1)
          u_2 : input rank-2 array('d') with bounds (nx + 1,ny + 1)
          f : input rank-2 array('d') with bounds (nx + 1,ny + 1)
          cx2 : input float
          cy2 : input float
          dt2 : input float
        Optional arguments:
          nx := (shape(u,0)-1) input int
          ny := (shape(u,1)-1) input int
        Return objects:
          u : rank-2 array('d') with bounds (nx + 1,ny + 1)

Here we see that the ``nx`` and ``ny`` parameters declared in
Fortran are optional arguments that can be omitted when calling
``advance`` from Python.

We strongly recommend to print out the
documentation of *every* Fortran function to be called from Python
and make sure the call syntax is exactly as listed in the
documentation.

How to avoid array copying
--------------------------

.. index:: row-major ordering

.. index:: column-major ordering

.. index:: Fortran array storage

.. index:: C/Python array storage

Multi-dimensional arrays are stored as a stream of numbers in memory.
For a two-dimensional array consisting of rows and columns there are
two ways of creating such a stream: *row-major ordering*, which means
that rows are stored consecutively in memory, or *column-major
ordering*, which means that the columns are stored one after each other.
All programming languages inherited from C, including Python, apply
the row-major ordering, but Fortran uses column-major storage.
Thinking of a two-dimensional array in Python or C
as a matrix, it means that Fortran
works with the transposed matrix.

Fortunately, ``f2py`` creates extra code so that accessing ``u(i,j)`` in
the Fortran subroutine corresponds to the element ``u[i,j]`` in the
underlying ``numpy`` array (without the extra code, ``u(i,j)`` in Fortran
would access ``u[j,i]`` in the ``numpy`` array).  Technically, ``f2py``
takes a copy of our ``numpy`` array and reorders the data before
sending the array to Fortran. Such copying can be costly. For 2D wave
simulations on a :math:`60\times 60` grid the overhead of copying is a
factor of 5, which means that almost the whole performance gain of
Fortran over vectorized ``numpy`` code is lost!

To avoid having ``f2py`` to copy
arrays with C storage to the corresponding Fortran storage, we declare
the arrays with Fortran storage:

.. code-block:: python

        order = 'Fortran' if version == 'f77' else 'C'
        u   = zeros((Nx+1,Ny+1), order=order)   # solution array
        u_1 = zeros((Nx+1,Ny+1), order=order)   # solution at t-dt
        u_2 = zeros((Nx+1,Ny+1), order=order)   # solution at t-2*dt

In the compile and build step of using ``f2py``, it is recommended to add
an extra option for making ``f2py`` report on array copying:

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> f2py -c wave2D_u0_loop_f77.pyf --build-dir build_f77 \ 
                  -DF2PY_REPORT_ON_ARRAY_COPY=1 wave2D_u0_loop_f77.f

It can sometimes be a challenge to track down which array that causes
a copying. There are two principal reasons for copying array data:
either the array does not have Fortran storage or the element types do
not match those declared in the Fortran code. The latter cause is
usually effectively eliminated by using ``real*8`` data in the Fortran
code and ``float64`` (the default ``float`` type in ``numpy``) in the arrays
on the Python side. The former reason is more common, and to check
whether an array before a Fortran call has the right storage one can
print the result of ``isfortran(a)``, which is ``True`` if the array ``a``
has Fortran storage.

Let us look at an example where we face problems with array storage.
A typical problem in the ``wave2D_u0.py`` code is
to set

.. code-block:: python

        f_a = f(xv, yv, t[n])

before the call to the Fortran ``advance`` routine. This computation creates
a new array with C storage. An undesired copy of ``f_a`` will be produced
when sending ``f_a`` to a Fortran routine.
There are two remedies, either direct insertion
of data in an array with Fortran storage,

.. code-block:: python

        f_a = zeros((Nx+1, Ny+1), order='Fortran')
        ...
        f_a[:,:] = f(xv, yv, t[n])

or remaking the ``f(xv, yv, t[n])`` array,

.. code-block:: python

        f_a = asarray(f(xv, yv, t[n]), order='Fortran')

The former remedy is most efficient if the ``asarray`` operation is to
be performed a large number of times.

Efficiency  (2)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The efficiency of this Fortran code is very similar to the Cython code.
There is usually nothing more to gain, from a computational efficiency
point of view, by implementing the *complete* Python program in Fortran
or C. That will just be a lot more code for all administering work
that is needed in scientific software, especially if we extend our
sample program ``wave2D_u0.py`` to handle a real scientific problem.
Then only a small portion will consist of loops with intensive
array calculations. These can be migrated to Cython or Fortran as
explained, while the rest of the programming can be more conveniently
done in Python.

Migrating loops to C via Cython
===============================

The computationally intensive loops can alternatively be implemented
in C code. Just as Fortran calls for care regarding the storage of
two-dimensional arrays, working with two-dimensional arrays in C
is a bit tricky. The reason is that
``numpy`` arrays are viewed as one-dimensional arrays when
transferred to C, while C programmers will think of ``u``, ``u_1``, and
``u_2`` as two dimensional arrays and index them like ``u[i][j]``.
The C code must declare ``u`` as ``double* u`` and translate an index
pair ``[i][j]`` to a corresponding single index when ``u`` is
viewed as one-dimensional. This translation requires knowledge of
how the numbers in ``u`` are stored in memory.

Translating index pairs to single indices
-----------------------------------------

Two-dimensional ``numpy`` arrays with the default C storage are stored
row by row. In general, multi-dimensional arrays with C storage are
stored such that the last index has the fastest variation, then the
next last index, and so on, ending up with the slowest variation
in the first index. For a two-dimensional ``u`` declared as
``zeros((Nx+1,Ny+1))`` in Python, the individual elements are stored
in the following order:

.. code-block:: python

        u[0,0], u[0,1], u[0,2], ..., u[0,Ny], u[1,0], u[1,1], ...,
        u[1,Ny], u[2,0], ..., u[Nx,0], u[Nx,1], ..., u[Nx, Ny]

Viewing ``u`` as one-dimensional, the index pair :math:`(i,j)` translates
to :math:`i(N_y+1)+j`. So, where a C programmer would naturally write
an index ``u[i][j]``, the indexing must read ``u[i*(Ny+1) + j]``.
This is tedious to write, so it can be handy to define a C macro,

.. code-block:: c

        #define idx(i,j) (i)*(Ny+1) + j

so that we can write ``u[idx(i,j)]``, which reads much better and is
easier to debug.


.. admonition:: Be careful with macro definitions

   Macros just perform simple text substitutions:
   ``idx(hello,world)`` is expanded to ``(hello)*(Ny+1) + world``.
   The parenthesis in ``(i)`` are essential - using the natural mathematical
   formula ``i*(Ny+1) + j`` in the macro definition,
   ``idx(i-1,j)`` would expand to ``i-1*(Ny+1) + j``, which is the wrong
   formula. Macros are handy, but requires careful use.
   In C++, inline functions are safer and replace the need for macros.




The complete C code
-------------------

The C version of our function ``advance`` can be coded as follows.

.. code-block:: c

        #define idx(i,j) (i)*(Ny+1) + j
        
        void advance(double* u, double* u_1, double* u_2, double* f,
        	     double Cx2, double Cy2, double dt2, int Nx, int Ny)
        {
          int i, j;
          double u_xx, u_yy;
          /* Scheme at interior points */
          for (i=1; i<=Nx-1; i++) {
            for (j=1; j<=Ny-1; j++) {
              u_xx = u_1[idx(i-1,j)] - 2*u_1[idx(i,j)] + u_1[idx(i+1,j)];
              u_yy = u_1[idx(i,j-1)] - 2*u_1[idx(i,j)] + u_1[idx(i,j+1)];
              u[idx(i,j)] = 2*u_1[idx(i,j)] - u_2[idx(i,j)] +
        	Cx2*u_xx + Cy2*u_yy + dt2*f[idx(i,j)];
            }
          }
          /* Boundary conditions */
          j = 0;  for (i=0; i<=Nx; i++) u[idx(i,j)] = 0;
          j = Ny; for (i=0; i<=Nx; i++) u[idx(i,j)] = 0;
          i = 0;  for (j=0; j<=Ny; j++) u[idx(i,j)] = 0;
          i = Nx; for (j=0; j<=Ny; j++) u[idx(i,j)] = 0;
        }

The Cython interface file
-------------------------

All the code above appears in a file `wave2D_u0_loop_c.c <http://tinyurl.com/nm5587k/wave//wave2D_u0/wave2D_u0_loop_c.c>`__.
We need to compile this file together with C wrapper code such that
``advance`` can be called from Python. Cython can be used to generate
appropriate wrapper code.
The relevant Cython code for interfacing C is
placed in a file with extension ``.pyx``. Here this file, called
`wave2D_u0_loop_c_cy.pyx <http://tinyurl.com/nm5587k/wave/wave2D_u0/wave2D_u0_loop_c_cy.pyx>`__, looks like

.. code-block:: cython

        import numpy as np
        cimport numpy as np
        cimport cython
        
        cdef extern from "wave2D_u0_loop_c.h":
            void advance(double* u, double* u_1, double* u_2, double* f,
                         double Cx2, double Cy2, double dt2,
                         int Nx, int Ny)
        
        @cython.boundscheck(False)
        @cython.wraparound(False)
        def advance_cwrap(
            np.ndarray[double, ndim=2, mode='c'] u,
            np.ndarray[double, ndim=2, mode='c'] u_1,
            np.ndarray[double, ndim=2, mode='c'] u_2,
            np.ndarray[double, ndim=2, mode='c'] f,
            double Cx2, double Cy2, double dt2):
            advance(&u[0,0], &u_1[0,0], &u_2[0,0], &f[0,0],
                    Cx2, Cy2, dt2,
                    u.shape[0]-1, u.shape[1]-1)
            return u

We first declare the C functions to be interfaced.
These must also appear in a C header file, `wave2D_u0_loop_c.h <http://tinyurl.com/nm5587k/wave/wave2D_u0/wave2D_u0_loop_c.h>`__,

.. code-block:: c++

        extern void advance(double* u, double* u_1, double* u_2, double* f,
        		    double Cx2, double Cy2, double dt2,
        		    int Nx, int Ny);

The next step is to write a Cython function with Python objects as arguments.
The name ``advance`` is already used for the C function so the function
to be called from Python is named ``advance_cwrap``. The contents of
this function is simply a call to the ``advance`` version in C. To this end,
the right information from the Python objects must be passed on as
arguments to ``advance``. Arrays are sent with their C pointers to the
first element, obtained in Cython as ``&u[0,0]`` (the ``&`` takes the
address of a C variable). The ``Nx`` and ``Ny`` arguments in ``advance`` are
easily obtained from the shape of the ``numpy`` array ``u``.
Finally, ``u`` must be returned such that we can set ``u = advance(...)``
in Python.

Building the extension module  (2)
----------------------------------

It remains to build the extension module. An appropriate
``setup.py`` file is

.. code-block:: python

        from distutils.core import setup
        from distutils.extension import Extension
        from Cython.Distutils import build_ext
        
        sources = ['wave2D_u0_loop_c.c', 'wave2D_u0_loop_c_cy.pyx']
        module = 'wave2D_u0_loop_c_cy'
        setup(
          name=module,
          ext_modules=[Extension(module, sources,
                                 libraries=[], # C libs to link with
                                 )],
          cmdclass={'build_ext': build_ext},
        )

All we need to specify is the ``.c`` file(s) and the ``.pyx`` interface
file. Cython is automatically run to generate the necessary wrapper
code. Files are then compiled and linked to an extension module
residing in the file ``wave2D_u0_loop_c_cy.so``. Here is a
session with running ``setup.py``
and examining the resulting module in Python

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> python setup.py build_ext --inplace
        Terminal> python
        >>> import wave2D_u0_loop_c_cy as m
        >>> dir(m)
        ['__builtins__', '__doc__', '__file__', '__name__', '__package__',
         '__test__', 'advance_cwrap', 'np']

The call to the C version of ``advance`` can go like this in Python:

.. code-block:: python

        import wave2D_u0_loop_c_cy
        advance = wave2D_u0_loop_c_cy.advance_cwrap
        ...
        f_a[:,:] = f(xv, yv, t[n])
        u = advance(u, u_1, u_2, f_a, Cx2, Cy2, dt2)

Efficiency  (3)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this example, the C and Fortran code runs at the same speed, and there
are no significant differences in the efficiency of the wrapper code.
The overhead implied by the wrapper code is negligible as long as
we do not work with very small meshes and consequently little numerical
work in the ``advance`` function.

Migrating loops to C via f2py
=============================

An alternative to using Cython for interfacing C code is to apply
``f2py``. The C code is the same, just the details of specifying how
it is to be called from Python differ. The ``f2py`` tool requires
the call specification to be a Fortran 90 module defined in a ``.pyf``
file. This file was automatically generated when we interfaced a
Fortran subroutine. With a C function we need to write this module
ourselves, or we can use a trick and let ``f2py`` generate it for us.
The trick consists in writing the signature of the C function with
Fortran syntax and place it in a Fortran file, here
``wave2D_u0_loop_c_f2py_signature.f``:

.. code-block:: fortran

              subroutine advance(u, u_1, u_2, f, Cx2, Cy2, dt2, Nx, Ny)
        Cf2py intent(c) advance
              integer Nx, Ny, N
              real*8 u(0:Nx,0:Ny), u_1(0:Nx,0:Ny), u_2(0:Nx,0:Ny)
              real*8 f(0:Nx, 0:Ny), Cx2, Cy2, dt2
        Cf2py intent(in, out) u
        Cf2py intent(c) u, u_1, u_2, f, Cx2, Cy2, dt2, Nx, Ny
              return
              end

Note that we need a special ``f2py`` instruction, through a ``Cf2py``
comment line, to specify that all the function arguments are
C variables. We also need to tell that the function is actually
in C: ``intent(c) advance``.

Since ``f2py`` is just concerned with the function signature and not the
complete contents of the function body, it can easily generate the
Fortran 90 module specification based solely on the signature above:

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> f2py -m wave2D_u0_loop_c_f2py \ 
                  -h wave2D_u0_loop_c_f2py.pyf --overwrite-signature \ 
                  wave2D_u0_loop_c_f2py_signature.f

The compile and build step is as for the Fortran code, except that we
list C files instead of Fortran files:

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> f2py -c wave2D_u0_loop_c_f2py.pyf \ 
                  --build-dir tmp_build_c \ 
                  -DF2PY_REPORT_ON_ARRAY_COPY=1 wave2D_u0_loop_c.c

As when interfacing Fortran code with ``f2py``, we need to print out
the doc string to see the exact call syntax from the Python side.
This doc string is identical for the C and Fortran versions of
``advance``.

.. ===== Migrating loops to C via Instant =====

Migrating loops to C++ via f2py
-------------------------------

C++ is a much more versatile language than C or Fortran and has over
the last two decades become very popular for numerical computing.
Many will therefore prefer to migrate compute-intensive Python code
to C++. This is, in principle, easy: just write the desired C++ code
and use some tool for interfacing it from Python. A tool like
`SWIG <http://swig.org/>`__ can interpret the C++ code and generate
interfaces for a wide range of
languages, including Python, Perl, Ruby, and Java.
However, SWIG is a comprehensive tool with a correspondingly
steep learning curve. Alternative tools, such as
`Boost Python <http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_51_0/libs/python/doc/index.html>`__, `SIP <http://riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/sip/intro>`__,
and `Shiboken <http://qt-project.org/wiki/Category:LanguageBindings::PySide::Shiboken>`__
are similarly comprehensive. Simpler tools include
`PyBindGen <http://code.google.com/p/pybindgen/>`__,

.. More tools for interfacing C++ from Python

A technically much easier way of interfacing C++ code is to drop the
possibility to use C++ classes directly from Python, but instead
make a C interface to the C++ code. The C interface can be handled
by ``f2py`` as shown in the example with pure C code. Such a solution
means that classes in Python and C++ cannot be mixed and that only
primitive data types like numbers, strings, and arrays can be
transferred between Python and C++. Actually, this is often a very
good solution because it forces the C++ code to work on array data,
which usually gives faster code than if fancy data structures with
classes are used. The arrays coming from Python, and looking like
plain C/C++ arrays, can be efficiently wrapped in more user-friendly
C++ array classes in the C++ code, if desired.

.. _softeng2:exer:savez:

Exercise 1: Make an improved ``numpy.savez`` function
-----------------------------------------------------

The ``numpy.savez`` function can save multiple arrays to a zip archive.
Unfortunately, if we want to use ``savez`` in time-dependent problems
and call it multiple times (once per time level), each call leads
to a separate zip archive. It is more convenient to have all
arrays in one archive, which can be read by ``numpy.load``.
The section :ref:`softeng2:wave1D:filestorage` provides a recipe for
merging all the individual zip archives into one archive.
An alternative is to write a new ``savez`` function that allows
multiple calls and storage into the same archive prior to a final
``close`` method to close the archive and make it ready for reading.
Implement such an improved ``savez`` function as a class ``Savez``.

The class should pass the following unit test:

.. code-block:: python

        def test_Savez():
            import tempfile, os
            tmp = 'tmp_testarchive'
            database = Savez(tmp)
            for i in range(4):
                array = np.linspace(0, 5+i, 3)
                kwargs = {'myarray_%02d' % i: array}
                database.savez(**kwargs)
            database.close()
        
            database = np.load(tmp+'.npz')
        
            expected = {
                'myarray_00': np.array([ 0. ,  2.5,  5. ]),
                'myarray_01': np.array([ 0.,  3.,  6.])
                'myarray_02': np.array([ 0. ,  3.5,  7. ]),
                'myarray_03': np.array([ 0.,  4.,  8.]),
                }
            for name in database:
                computed = database[name]
                diff = np.abs(expected[name] - computed).max()
                assert diff < 1E-13
            database.close
            os.remove(tmp+'.npz')
