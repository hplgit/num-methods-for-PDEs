<p class="first admonition-title">Purpose</p>
<p>Truncation error analysis provides a widely applicable framework for
analyzing the accuracy of finite difference schemes. This type of
analysis can also be used for finite element and finite volume methods
if the discrete equations are written in finite difference form.  The
result of the analysis is an asymptotic estimate of the error in the
scheme on the form <span class="math">\(Ch^r\)</span>, where <span class="math">\(h\)</span> is a discretization parameter
(<span class="math">\(\Delta t\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\Delta x\)</span>, etc.), <span class="math">\(r\)</span> is a number, known as the convergence
rate, and <span class="math">\(C\)</span> is a constant, typically dependent on the
derivatives of the exact solution.</p>
<p>Knowing <span class="math">\(r\)</span> gives understanding of the accuracy of the scheme. But
maybe even more important, a powerful verification method for computer
codes is to check that the empirically observed convergence rates in
experiments coincide with the theoretical value of <span class="math">\(r\)</span> found from
truncation error analysis.</p>
<p class="last">The analysis
can be carried out by hand, by symbolic software, and also
numerically. All three methods will be illustrated.
From examining the symbolic expressions of the truncation error
we can add correction terms to the differential equations in order
to increase the numerical accuracy.</p>
</div>
<p>In general, the term truncation error refers to the discrepancy that
arises from performing a finite number of steps to approximate a
process with infinitely many steps. The term is used in a number
of contexts, including truncation of infinite series, finite
precision arithmetic, finite differences, and differential equations.
We shall be concerned with computing truncation errors arising in
finite difference formulas and in finite difference discretizations
of differential equations.</p>

<div class="section" id="abstract-problem-setting">
<h2>Abstract problem setting<a class="headerlink" href="#abstract-problem-setting" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Consider an abstract differential equation</p>
<div class="math">
\[\mathcal{L}(u)=0,\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(\mathcal{L}(u)\)</span> is some formula involving the unknown <span class="math">\(u\)</span> and
its derivatives. One example is <span class="math">\(\mathcal{L}(u)=u'(t)+a(t)u(t)-b(t)\)</span>, where
<span class="math">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b\)</span> are contants or functions of time.
We can discretize the differential equation and obtain a corresponding
discrete model, here written as</p>
<div class="math">
\[\mathcal{L}_{\Delta}(u) =0{\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>The solution <span class="math">\(u\)</span> of this equation is the <em>numerical solution</em>.
To distinguish the
numerical solution from the exact solution of the differential
equation problem,
we denote the latter by <span class="math">\({u_{\small\mbox{e}}}\)</span> and write the
differential equation and its discrete counterpart as</p>
<div class="math">
\[\begin{split}\mathcal{L}({u_{\small\mbox{e}}})&amp;=0,\\
\mathcal{L}_\Delta (u)&amp;=0{\thinspace .}\end{split}\]</div>
<p>Initial and/or boundary conditions can usually be left out of the truncation
error analysis and are omitted in the following.</p>
<p>The numerical solution <span class="math">\(u\)</span> is in a finite difference method computed
at a collection of mesh points. The discrete equations represented
by the abstract equation <span class="math">\(\mathcal{L}_\Delta (u)=0\)</span> are usually
algebraic equations involving <span class="math">\(u\)</span> at some
neighboring mesh points.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="error-measures">
<h2>Error measures<a class="headerlink" href="#error-measures" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A key issue is how accurate the numerical solution is.
The ultimate way of addressing this issue would be to compute
the error <span class="math">\({u_{\small\mbox{e}}} - u\)</span> at the mesh points. This is usually extremely demanding.
In very simplified problem settings we may, however, manage to
derive formulas for the numerical solution <span class="math">\(u\)</span>, and
therefore closed form expressions
for the error <span class="math">\({u_{\small\mbox{e}}} - u\)</span>. Such special cases can provide
considerable insight regarding accuracy and stability, but
the results are established for special problems.</p>
<p>The error <span class="math">\({u_{\small\mbox{e}}} -u\)</span> can be computed empirically in special cases where
we know <span class="math">\({u_{\small\mbox{e}}}\)</span>. Such cases can be constructed by the method of
manufactured solutions, where we choose some exact solution <span class="math">\({u_{\small\mbox{e}}} = v\)</span>
and fit a source term <span class="math">\(f\)</span> in the governing differential equation
<span class="math">\(\mathcal{L}({u_{\small\mbox{e}}})=f\)</span> such that <span class="math">\({u_{\small\mbox{e}}}=v\)</span> is a solution (i.e.,
<span class="math">\(f=\mathcal{L}(v)\)</span>).  Assuming an error model of the form <span class="math">\(Ch^r\)</span>,
where <span class="math">\(h\)</span> is the discretization parameter, such as <span class="math">\(\Delta t\)</span> or
<span class="math">\(\Delta x\)</span>, one can estimate the convergence rate <span class="math">\(r\)</span>. This is a
widely applicable procedure, but the valididity of the results is,
strictly speaking, tied to the chosen test problems.</p>
<p>Another error measure is to ask to what extent the exact solution
<span class="math">\({u_{\small\mbox{e}}}\)</span> fits the discrete equations. Clearly, <span class="math">\({u_{\small\mbox{e}}}\)</span> is in general
not a solution of <span class="math">\(\mathcal{L}_\Delta(u)=0\)</span>, but we can define
the residual</p>
<div class="math">
\[R = \mathcal{L}_\Delta({u_{\small\mbox{e}}}),\]</div>
<p>and investigate how close <span class="math">\(R\)</span> is to zero. A small <span class="math">\(R\)</span> means
intuitively that the discrete equations are close to the
differential equation, and then we are tempted to think that
<span class="math">\(u^n\)</span> must also be close to <span class="math">\({u_{\small\mbox{e}}}(t_n)\)</span>.</p>
<p>The residual <span class="math">\(R\)</span> is known as the truncation error of the finite
difference scheme <span class="math">\(\mathcal{L}_\Delta(u)=0\)</span>.  It appears that the
truncation error is relatively straightforward to compute by hand or
symbolic software <em>without specializing the differential equation
and the discrete model to a special case</em>. The resulting <span class="math">\(R\)</span> is found
as a power series in the discretization parameters. The leading-order
terms in the series provide an asymptotic measure of the accuracy of
the numerical solution method (as the discretization parameters
tend to zero). An advantage of truncation error analysis compared
empricial estimation of convergence rates or detailed analysis
of a special problem with a mathematical expression for the numerical
solution, is that the truncation error analysis reveals the
accuracy of the various building blocks in the numerical method and
how each building block impacts the overall accuracy. The analysis
can therefore be used to detect building blocks with lower accuracy
than the others.</p>
<p>Knowing the truncation error or other error measures is important for
verification of programs by empirically establishing convergence
rates. The forthcoming text will provide many examples on how to
compute truncation errors for finite difference discretizations of
ODEs and PDEs.</p>

<p>The accuracy of a finite difference formula is a fundamental issue
when discretizing differential equations. We shall first go through a
particular example in detail and thereafter list the truncation error
in the most common finite difference approximation formulas.</p>

</ol>
<p>The result is an expression for <span class="math">\(R^n\)</span> in terms of a power series in
<span class="math">\(\Delta t\)</span>. The error <span class="math">\(R^n\)</span> is commonly referred to as the <em>truncation

<p>The Taylor series formula often found in calculus books takes the form</p>
<div class="math">
\[f(x+h) = \sum_{i=0}^\infty \frac{1}{i!}\frac{d^if}{dx^i}(x)h^i{\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>In our application,
we expand the Taylor series around the point where the finite difference
formula approximates the derivative. The Taylor series of <span class="math">\(u^n\)</span> at <span class="math">\(t_n\)</span>
is simply <span class="math">\(u(t_n)\)</span>, while the Taylor sereis of <span class="math">\(u^{n-1}\)</span> at <span class="math">\(t_n\)</span> must
employ the general formula,</p>
<div class="math">
\[\begin{split}u(t_{n-1}) = u(t-\Delta t) &amp;= \sum_{i=0}^\infty \frac{1}{i!}\frac{d^iu}{dt^i}(t_n)(-\Delta t)^i\\
&amp; = u(t_n) - u'(t_n)\Delta t + {\frac{1}{2}}u''(t_n)\Delta t^2
+ {\mathcal{O}(\Delta t^3)},\end{split}\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\({\mathcal{O}(\Delta t^3)}\)</span> means a power-series in <span class="math">\(\Delta t\)</span> where
the lowest power is <span class="math">\(\Delta t^3\)</span>. We assume that <span class="math">\(\Delta t\)</span> is small such that
<span class="math">\(\Delta t^p \gg \Delta t^q\)</span> if <span class="math">\(p\)</span> is smaller than <span class="math">\(q\)</span>.
The details of higher-order terms
in <span class="math">\(\Delta t\)</span> are therefore not of much interest.
Inserting the Taylor series above in the left-hand side of1
<a href="#equation-trunc:fd:bw3">(2)</a> gives rise to some algebra:</p>
<div class="math">
\[\begin{split}[D_t^-u]^n - u'(t_n) &amp;= \frac{u(t_n) - u(t_{n-1})}{\Delta t} - u'(t_n)\\

&amp;= -{\frac{1}{2}}u''(t_n)\Delta t + {\mathcal{O}(\Delta t^2)} ),\end{split}\]</div>
<p>which is, according to
<a href="#equation-trunc:fd:bw3">(2)</a>, the truncation error:</p>
<div class="math">
\[R^n = - {\frac{1}{2}}u''(t_n)\Delta t + {\mathcal{O}(\Delta t^2)} )

<p>The dominating term for small <span class="math">\(\Delta t\)</span> is <span class="math">\(-{\frac{1}{2}}u''(t_n)\Delta t\)</span>,
which is proportional to <span class="math">\(\Delta t\)</span>, and we say that the truncation error

<p>We can use <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sympy</span></tt> to aid calculations with Taylor series.
The derivatives can be defined as symbols, say <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">D3f</span></tt> for the
3rd derivative of some function <span class="math">\(f\)</span>. A truncated Taylor series
can then be written as <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">f</span> <span class="pre">+</span> <span class="pre">D1f*h</span> <span class="pre">+</span> <span class="pre">D2f*h**2/2</span></tt>. The following
class takes some symbol <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">f</span></tt> for the function in question
and makes a list of symbols for the derivatives. The
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__call__</span></tt> method computes the symbolic form of the series
truncated at <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">num_terms</span></tt> terms.</p>

<p>The truncation error consists of the terms after the first one (<span class="math">\(u'\)</span>).</p>
<p>The module file <a class="reference external" href="http://tinyurl.com/jvzzcfn/trunc/truncation_errors.py">trunc/truncation_errors.py</a> contains another class <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">DiffOp</span></tt> with symbolic expressions for
most of the truncation errors listed in the previous section.
For example:</p>
<div class="highlight-text"><div class="highlight"><pre>&gt;&gt;&gt; from truncation_errors import DiffOp
&gt;&gt;&gt; from sympy import *
&gt;&gt;&gt; u = Symbol(&#39;u&#39;)

&gt;&gt;&gt; diffop[&#39;geometric_mean&#39;]
-D1u**2*dt**2/4 - D1u*D3u*dt**4/48 + D2u**2*dt**4/64 + ...
&gt;&gt;&gt; diffop[&#39;Dtm&#39;]
D1u + D2u*dt/2 + D3u*dt**2/6 + D4u*dt**3/24

 &#39;weighted_arithmetic_mean&#39;, &#39;Dtp&#39;, &#39;Dt&#39;]
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The indexing of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">diffop</span></tt> applies names that correspond to the operators:
