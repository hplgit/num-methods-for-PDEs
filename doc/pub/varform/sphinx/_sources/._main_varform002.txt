Examples on variational formulations
====================================

The following sections derive variational formulations for some
prototype differential equations in 1D, and demonstrate how we with
ease can handle variable coefficients, mixed Dirichlet and Neumann
boundary conditions, first-order derivatives, and nonlinearities.

Variable coefficient
--------------------

Consider the problem

.. _Eq:_auto29:

.. math::
   :label: _auto29
        
        -\frac{d}{dx}\left( {\alpha}(x)\frac{du}{dx}\right) = f(x),\quad x\in\Omega =[0,L],\ 
        u(0)=C,\ u(L)=D{\thinspace .}
        
        

There are two new features of this problem compared with
previous examples: a variable
coefficient :math:`{\alpha} (x)` and nonzero Dirichlet conditions at both boundary points.

Let us first deal with the boundary conditions. We seek

.. math::
         u(x) = B(x) + \sum_{j\in{\mathcal{I}_s}} c_j{\psi}_i(x){\thinspace .}

Since the Dirichlet conditions demand

.. math::
         {\psi}_i(0)={\psi}_i(L)=0,\quad i\in{\mathcal{I}_s},

the function :math:`B(x)`
must fulfill :math:`B(0)=C` and :math:`B(L)=D`. The we are guaranteed that :math:`u(0)=C`
and :math:`u(L)=D`. How :math:`B` varies in between
:math:`x=0` and :math:`x=L` is not of importance. One possible choice is

.. math::
         B(x) = C + \frac{1}{L}(D-C)x,

which follows from :ref:`(2.52) <Eq:fem:deq:1D:essBC:Bfunc:gen>` with :math:`p=1`.

We seek :math:`(u-B)\in V`. As usual,

.. math::
         V = \hbox{span}\{{\psi}_0,\ldots,{\psi}_N\}{\thinspace .}

Note that any :math:`v\in V` has the property :math:`v(0)=v(L)=0`.

The residual arises by inserting our :math:`u` in the differential equation:

.. math::
         R = -\frac{d}{dx}\left( {\alpha}\frac{du}{dx}\right) -f{\thinspace .} 

Galerkin's method is

.. math::
        
        (R, v) = 0,\quad \forall v\in V,
        

or written with explicit integrals,

.. math::
        
        \int_{\Omega} \left(-\frac{d}{dx}\left( {\alpha}\frac{du}{dx}\right) -f\right)v {\, \mathrm{d}x} = 0,\quad \forall v\in V {\thinspace .}
        

We proceed with integration by parts to lower the derivative from
second to first order:

.. math::
         -\int_{\Omega} \frac{d}{dx}\left( {\alpha}(x)\frac{du}{dx}\right) v {\, \mathrm{d}x}
        = \int_{\Omega} {\alpha}(x)\frac{du}{dx}\frac{dv}{dx}{\, \mathrm{d}x} -
        \left[{\alpha}\frac{du}{dx}v\right]_0^L
        {\thinspace .}
        

The boundary term vanishes since :math:`v(0)=v(L)=0`.
The variational formulation is then

.. math::
        
        \int_{\Omega} {\alpha}(x)\frac{du}{dx}\frac{dv}{dx}{\, \mathrm{d}x} = \int_{\Omega} f(x)v{\, \mathrm{d}x},\quad
        \forall v\in V{\thinspace .}
        

The variational formulation can alternatively be written in a more
compact form:

.. math::
        
        ({\alpha} u',v') = (f,v),\quad \forall v\in V
        {\thinspace .}
        

The corresponding abstract notation reads

.. math::
         a(u,v)=L(v)\quad\forall v\in V,

with

.. math::
         a(u,v)= ({\alpha} u',v'),\quad L(v)=(f,v) {\thinspace .}  

We may insert :math:`u=B + \sum_jc_j{\psi}_j` and :math:`v={\psi}_i` to
derive the linear system:

.. math::
        
        ({\alpha} B' + {\alpha} \sum_{j\in{\mathcal{I}_s}} c_j {\psi}_j', {\psi}_i') =
        (f,{\psi}_i), \quad i\in{\mathcal{I}_s} {\thinspace .}
        

Isolating everything with the :math:`c_j` coefficients on the left-hand side
and all known terms on the right-hand side
gives

.. math::
         \sum_{j\in{\mathcal{I}_s}} ({\alpha}{\psi}_j', {\psi}_i')c_j  =
        (f,{\psi}_i) + (a(D-C)L^{-1}, {\psi}_i'), \quad i\in{\mathcal{I}_s}
        {\thinspace .}
        

This is nothing but a linear system :math:`\sum_j A_{i,j}c_j=b_i`
with

.. math::
        
        A_{i,j} &= (a{\psi}_j', {\psi}_i') = \int_{\Omega} {\alpha}(x){\psi}_j'(x),
        {\psi}_i'(x){\, \mathrm{d}x},\\ 
        b_i &= (f,{\psi}_i) + (a(D-C)L^{-1},{\psi}_i')=
        \int_{\Omega} \left(f(x){\psi}_i(x) + {\alpha}(x)\frac{D-C}{L}{\psi}_i'(x)\right) {\, \mathrm{d}x}
        {\thinspace .}
        

First-order derivative in the equation and boundary condition
-------------------------------------------------------------

The next problem to formulate in terms of a variational form reads

.. _Eq:_auto30:

.. math::
   :label: _auto30
        
        -u''(x) + bu'(x) = f(x),\quad x\in\Omega =[0,L],\ 
        u(0)=C,\ u'(L)=E{\thinspace .}
        
        

The new features are a first-order derivative :math:`u'` in the equation
and the boundary
condition involving the derivative: :math:`u'(L)=E`.
Since we have a Dirichlet condition at :math:`x=0`,
we must force :math:`{\psi}_i(0)=0` and use a boundary function
to take care of the condition :math:`u(0)=C`.
Because there is no Dirichlet
condition on :math:`x=L` we do not make any requirements to :math:`{\psi}_i(L)`.
The simplest possible choice of :math:`B(x)` is :math:`B(x)=C`.

The expansion for :math:`u` becomes

.. math::
         u = C + \sum_{j\in{\mathcal{I}_s}} c_j {\psi}_i(x)
        {\thinspace .}
        

The variational formulation arises from multiplying the equation by
a test function :math:`v\in V` and integrating over :math:`\Omega`:

.. math::
          (-u'' + bu' - f, v) = 0,\quad\forall v\in V

We apply integration by parts to the :math:`u''v` term only. Although we could
also integrate :math:`u' v` by parts, this is not common.
The result becomes

.. math::
         (u',v') + (bu',v) = (f,v) + [u' v]_0^L, \quad\forall v\in V {\thinspace .} 

Now, :math:`v(0)=0` so

.. math::
         [u' v]_0^L = u'(L)v(L) = E v(L),

because :math:`u'(L)=E`.
Thus, integration by parts allows us to take care of the Neumann condition
in the boundary term.

.. index:: natural boundary condition

.. index:: essential boundary condition


.. admonition:: Natural and essential boundary conditions

   A common mistake is to forget a boundary term like :math:`[u'v]_0^L` in
   the integration by parts. Such a mistake implies that we actually
   impose the condition :math:`u'=0` unless there is a Dirichlet condition
   (i.e., :math:`v=0`) at that point! This fact has great practical
   consequences, because it is easy to forget the boundary term, and that
   implicitly set a boundary condition!
   
   Since homogeneous Neumann conditions can be incorporated without
   "doing anything" (i.e., omitting the boundary term), and
   non-homogeneous Neumann conditions can just be inserted in the
   boundary term, such conditions are known as *natural boundary
   conditions*.  Dirichlet conditions require more essential steps in the
   mathematical formulation, such as forcing all :math:`{\varphi}_i=0` on the
   boundary and constructing a :math:`B(x)`, and are therefore known as
   *essential boundary conditions*.




The final variational form reads

.. math::
         (u',v') + (bu',v) = (f,v) + E v(L), \quad\forall v\in V {\thinspace .} 

In the abstract notation we have

.. math::
         a(u,v)=L(v)\quad\forall v\in V,

with the particular formulas

.. math::
         a(u,v)=(u',v') + (bu',v),\quad L(v)= (f,v) + E v(L){\thinspace .} 

The associated linear system is derived by inserting :math:`u=B+\sum_jc_j{\psi}_j`
and replacing :math:`v` by :math:`{\psi}_i` for :math:`i\in{\mathcal{I}_s}`. Some algebra results in

.. math::
         \sum_{j\in{\mathcal{I}_s}} \underbrace{(({\psi}_j',{\psi}_i') + (b{\psi}_j',{\psi}_i))}_{A_{i,j}} c_j = \underbrace{(f,{\psi}_i) + E {\psi}_i(L)}_{b_i}
        {\thinspace .}
        

Observe that in this problem, the coefficient matrix is not symmetric,
because of the term

.. math::
        
        (b{\psi}_j',{\psi}_i)=\int_{\Omega} b{\psi}_j'{\psi}_i {\, \mathrm{d}x}
         \neq \int_{\Omega} b {\psi}_i' {\psi}_j {\, \mathrm{d}x} = ({\psi}_i',b{\psi}_j)
        {\thinspace .}
        

.. Too early:

.. For finite element basis functions, it is worth noticing that the boundary term

.. :math:`E{\psi}_i(L)` is nonzero only in the entry :math:`b_N` since all

.. :math:`{\psi}_i`, :math:`i\neq N`, are zero at :math:`x=L`, provided the degrees of freedom

.. are numbered from left to right in 1D so that :math:`x_{N}=L`.

Nonlinear coefficient
---------------------

Finally, we show that the techniques used above to derive variational
forms apply to nonlinear differential equation
problems as well. Here is a model problem with
a nonlinear coefficient :math:`\alpha(u)` and a nonlinear right-hand side :math:`f(u)`:

.. _Eq:_auto31:

.. math::
   :label: _auto31
        
        -({\alpha}(u)u')' = f(u),\quad x\in [0,L],\ u(0)=0,\ u'(L)=E
        {\thinspace .}
        
        

Our space :math:`V` has basis :math:`\left\{ {{\psi}}_i \right\}_{i\in{\mathcal{I}_s}}`, and because of the
condition :math:`u(0)=0`, we must require :math:`{\psi}_i(0)=0`, :math:`i\in{\mathcal{I}_s}`.

Galerkin's method is about inserting the approximate
:math:`u`, multiplying the differential equation by :math:`v\in V`, and integrate,

.. math::
         -\int_0^L \frac{d}{dx}\left({\alpha}(u)\frac{du}{dx}\right)v {\, \mathrm{d}x} =
        \int_0^L f(u)v {\, \mathrm{d}x}\quad\forall v\in V
        {\thinspace .}
        

The integration by parts does not differ from the case where we have
:math:`{\alpha}(x)` instead of :math:`{\alpha}(u)`:

.. math::
         \int_0^L {\alpha}(u)\frac{du}{dx}\frac{dv}{dx}{\, \mathrm{d}x} =
        \int_0^L f(u)v{\, \mathrm{d}x} + [{\alpha}(u)vu']_0^L\quad\forall v\in V
        {\thinspace .}
        

The term :math:`{\alpha}(u(0))v(0)u'(0)=0` since :math:`v(0)`.
The other term, :math:`{\alpha}(u(L))v(L)u'(L)`,
is used to impose the other boundary condition :math:`u'(L)=E`, resulting in

.. math::
         \int_0^L {\alpha}(u)\frac{du}{dx}\frac{dv}{dx}{\, \mathrm{d}x} =
        \int_0^L f(u)v{\, \mathrm{d}x} + {\alpha}(u(L))v(L)E\quad\forall v\in V,
        

or alternatively written more compactly as

.. math::
         ({\alpha}(u)u', v') = (f(u),v) + {\alpha}(u(L))v(L)E\quad\forall v\in V
        {\thinspace .}
        

Since the problem is nonlinear, we cannot identify a bilinear
form :math:`a(u,v)` and a linear form :math:`L(v)`.
An abstract formulation is typically *find :math:`u` such that*

.. math::
         F(u;v) = 0\quad\forall v\in V,

with

.. math::
         F(u;v) = (a(u)u', v') - (f(u),v) - a(L)v(L)E
        {\thinspace .}
        

By inserting :math:`u=\sum_j c_j{\psi}_j` and :math:`v={\psi}_i` in :math:`F(u;v)`,
we get a *nonlinear system of
algebraic equations* for the unknowns :math:`c_i`, :math:`i\in{\mathcal{I}_s}`. Such systems must
be solved by constructing a sequence of linear systems whose solutions
hopefully converge to the solution of the nonlinear system. Frequently applied
methods are Picard iteration and Newton's method.

.. _fem:deq:1D:varform:ex:DN:case:

Computing with Dirichlet and Neumann conditions
-----------------------------------------------

.. ex_varform1D.py: case2

Let us perform the necessary calculations to solve

.. math::
        
        -u''(x)=2,\quad x\in \Omega=[0,1],\quad u'(0)=C,\ u(1)=D,
        

using a global polynomial basis :math:`{\psi}_i\sim x^i`.
The requirements on :math:`{\psi}_i` is that :math:`{\psi}_i(1)=0`, because :math:`u` is
specified at :math:`x=1`, so a proper set of polynomial basis functions can be

.. math::
         {\psi}_i(x)=(1-x)^{i+1}, \quad i\in{\mathcal{I}_s}{\thinspace .}

A suitable :math:`B(x)` function
to handle the boundary condition :math:`u(1)=D` is :math:`B(x)=Dx`.
The variational formulation becomes

.. math::
         (u',v') = (2,v) - Cv(0)\quad\forall v\in V{\thinspace .} 

From inserting :math:`u=B + \sum_{j}c_j{\psi}_j` and choosing :math:`v={\psi}_i` we get

.. math::
         \sum_{j\in{\mathcal{I}_s}} ({\psi}_j',{\psi}_i')c_j = (2,{\psi}_i)
        - (B',{\psi}_i') - C{\psi}_i(0),\quad i\in{\mathcal{I}_s}{\thinspace .}

The entries in the linear system are then

.. math::
        
        A_{i,j} &= ({\psi}_j',{\psi}_i') = \int_{0}^1 {\psi}_i'(x){\psi}_j'(x){\, \mathrm{d}x}
        = \int_0^1 (i+1)(j+1)(1-x)^{i+j}{\, \mathrm{d}x} = \frac{(i+1)(j+1)}{i + j + 1},\\ 
        b_i &= (2,{\psi}_i) - (D,{\psi}_i') -C{\psi}_i(0)\\ 
        &= \int_0^1\left( 2{\psi}_i(x) - D{\psi}_i'(x)\right){\, \mathrm{d}x} -C{\psi}_i(0)\\ 
        &= \int_0^1 \left( 2(1-x)^{i+1} - D(i+1)(1-x)^i\right){\, \mathrm{d}x}  -C\\ 
        &= \frac{(D-C)(i+2) + 2}{i+2} = D - C + \frac{2}{i+2}
        {\thinspace .}
        

Relevant ``sympy`` commands to help calculate these expressions are

.. code-block:: python

        from sympy import *
        x, C, D = symbols('x C D')
        i, j = symbols('i j', integer=True, positive=True)
        psi_i = (1-x)**(i+1)
        psi_j = psi_i.subs(i, j)
        integrand = diff(psi_i, x)*diff(psi_j, x)
        integrand = simplify(integrand)
        A_ij = integrate(integrand, (x, 0, 1))
        A_ij = simplify(A_ij)
        print 'A_ij:', A_ij
        f = 2
        b_i = integrate(f*psi_i, (x, 0, 1)) - \ 
              integrate(diff(D*x, x)*diff(psi_i, x), (x, 0, 1)) - \ 
              C*psi_i.subs(x, 0)
        b_i = simplify(b_i)
        print 'b_i:', b_i

The output becomes

.. code-block:: text

        A_ij: (i + 1)*(j + 1)/(i + j + 1)
        b_i: ((-C + D)*(i + 2) + 2)/(i + 2)

We can now choose some :math:`N` and form the linear system, say for :math:`N=1`:

.. code-block:: python

        N = 1
        A = zeros((N+1, N+1))
        b = zeros(N+1)
        print 'fresh b:', b
        for r in range(N+1):
            for s in range(N+1):
                A[r,s] = A_ij.subs(i, r).subs(j, s)
            b[r,0] = b_i.subs(i, r)

The system becomes

.. math::
        
        \left(\begin{array}{cc}
        1 & 1\\ 
        1 & 4/3
        \end{array}\right)
        \left(\begin{array}{c}
        c_0\\ 
        c_1
        \end{array}\right)
        =
        \left(\begin{array}{c}
        1-C+D\\ 
        2/3 -C + D
        \end{array}\right)
        

The solution (``c = A.LUsolve(b)``)
becomes :math:`c_0=2 -C+D` and :math:`c_1=-1`, resulting in

.. _Eq:_auto32:

.. math::
   :label: _auto32
        
        u(x) = 1 -x^2 + D + C(x-1),
        
        

We can form this :math:`u` in ``sympy`` and check that the differential equation
and the boundary conditions are satisfied:

.. code-block:: python

        u = sum(c[r,0]*psi_i.subs(i, r) for r in range(N+1)) + D*x
        print 'u:', simplify(u)
        print "u'':", simplify(diff(u, x, x))
        print 'BC x=0:', simplify(diff(u, x).subs(x, 0))
        print 'BC x=1:', simplify(u.subs(x, 1))

The output becomes

.. code-block:: text

        u: C*x - C + D - x**2 + 1
        u'': -2
        BC x=0: C
        BC x=1: D

The complete ``sympy`` code is found in `u_xx_2_CD.py <http://tinyurl.com/nm5587k/varform/u_xx_2_CD.py>`__.

The exact solution is found by integrating twice and applying the
boundary conditions, either by hand or using ``sympy`` as shown in
the section :ref:`fem:deq:1D:models:simple`.  It appears that the numerical
solution coincides with the exact one.  This result is to be expected
because if :math:`({u_{\small\mbox{e}}} - B)\in V`, :math:`u = {u_{\small\mbox{e}}}`, as proved next.

When the numerical method is exact
----------------------------------

We have some variational formulation: find :math:`(u-B)\in V` such that
:math:`a(u,v)=L(u)\ \forall V`. The exact solution also fulfills
:math:`a({u_{\small\mbox{e}}},v)=L(v)`, but normally :math:`({u_{\small\mbox{e}}} -B)` lies in a much larger
(infinite-dimensional) space. Suppose, nevertheless, that
:math:`{u_{\small\mbox{e}}} - B = E`, where :math:`E\in V`. That is, apart from Dirichlet conditions,
:math:`{u_{\small\mbox{e}}}` lies in our finite-dimensional space :math:`V` we use to compute :math:`u`.
Writing also :math:`u` on the same form :math:`u=B+F`, :math:`F\in V`, we have

.. math::
        
        a(B+E,v) &= L(v)\quad\forall v\in V,\\ 
        a(B+F,v) &= L(v)\quad\forall v\in V{\thinspace .}
        

Since these are two variational statements in the same space, we
can subtract them and use the bilinear property of :math:`a(\cdot,\cdot)`:

.. math::
        
        a(B+E,v) - a(B+F, v) &= L(v) - L(v)\\ 
        a(B+E-(B+F),v) &= 0\\ 
        a(E-F),v) &= 0
        

If :math:`a(E-F),v) = 0` for all :math:`v` in :math:`V`, then :math:`E-F` must be zero everywhere
in the domain, i.e., :math:`E=F`. Or in other words: :math:`u={u_{\small\mbox{e}}}`. This proves
that the exact solution is recovered if :math:`{u_{\small\mbox{e}}} - B` lies in :math:`V`., i.e.,
can expressed as :math:`\sum_{j\in{\mathcal{I}_s}}d_j{\psi}_j` if :math:`\{{\psi}_j\}_{j\in{\mathcal{I}_s}}`
is a basis for :math:`V`. The method will then compute the solution :math:`c_j=d_j`,
:math:`j\in{\mathcal{I}_s}`.

The case treated in the section :ref:`fem:deq:1D:varform:ex:DN:case`
is of the type where :math:`{u_{\small\mbox{e}}} - B` is a quadratic function that is 0
at :math:`x=1`, and therefore :math:`({u_{\small\mbox{e}}} -B)\in V`, and the method
finds the exact solution.
