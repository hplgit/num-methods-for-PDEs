Exercise 1: Refactor functions into a more general class
--------------------------------------------------------

The section :ref:`fem:deq:1D:models:simple` displays three functions
for computing the analytical solution of some simple
model problems. There is quite some repetitive code, suggesting
that the functions can benefit from being refactored into a
class where the user can define the :math:`f(x)`, :math:`{\alpha}(x)`, and the boundary
conditions in particular methods in subclasses. Demonstrate how
the new class can be used to solve the three particular
problems in the section :ref:`fem:deq:1D:models:simple`.

In the method that computes the solution, check that the solution
found fulfills the differential equation and the boundary conditions.

Exercise 2: Compute the deflection of a cable with sine functions
-----------------------------------------------------------------

A hanging cable of length :math:`L`
with significant tension :math:`T` has a downward deflection :math:`w(x)`
governed by

Solve

.. math::
        
        T w''(x) = \ell(x),
        

when :math:`\ell(x)` the vertical load per unit length.
The cable is fixed at :math:`x=0` and :math:`x=L` so the boundary conditions become
:math:`w(0)=w(L)=0`.

If we assume a constant load :math:`\ell(x)=\hbox{const}`,
the solution is expected to be symmetric around :math:`x=L/2`. For a function
:math:`w(x)` that is symmetric around some point :math:`x_0`, it means that
:math:`w(x_0-h) = w(x_0+h)`, and then :math:`w'(x_0)=\lim_{h\rightarrow 0}(w(x_0+h)-
w(x_0-h))/(2h)=0`. We can therefore halve the domain and
seek :math:`w(x)` in :math:`[0,L/2]` with boundary conditions :math:`w(0)=0` and
:math:`w'(L/2)=0`.

The problem can be scaled by introducing a dimensionless coordinate
(also called :math:`x`) in :math:`[0,1]` and a dimensionless vertical
deflection :math:`u(x)`.
The differential equation problem for :math:`u(x)` becomes

.. math::
        
        u'' = 1,\quad x\in (0,1),\quad u(0)=0,\ u'(1)=0{\thinspace .}
        

.. This basis function was wrong! Do this exercise, show that the

.. basis is orthogonal.

A possible function space is spanned by :math:`{\psi}_i=\sin ((2i+1)\pi x/2)`,
:math:`i=0,\ldots,N`.
Use a Galerkin and a least squares method to find the coefficients
:math:`c_j` in :math:`u(x)=\sum_j c_j{\psi}_j`. Find how fast the coefficients
decrease in magnitude by looking at :math:`c_j/c_{j-1}`.
Find the error in the maximum deflection at :math:`x=1` when only one
basis function is used (:math:`N=0`).

What happens if we choose basis functions
:math:`{\psi}_i=\sin ((i+1)\pi x)`? These basis functions are appropriate
if we do not utilize symmetry and solve the original problem on :math:`[0,L]`.
A scaled version of this problem reads

.. math::
         u''=1,\quad x\in(0,1),\quad u(0)=u(1)=0{\thinspace .}

Carry out the computations with :math:`N=0` and demonstrate that the
maximum deflection :math:`u(1/2)` is the same in the problem utilizing
symmetry and the problem covering the whole cable.

Exercise 6: Compute the deflection of a cable with a step load
--------------------------------------------------------------

We consider the deflection of a tension cable as described in
:ref:`fem:deq:exer:tension:cable`. Now the load is

.. math::
         \ell (x) =\left\lbrace\begin{array}{ll}
        \ell_1, & x <L/2,\\ 
        \ell_2, & x \geq L/2
        \end{array}\right.\quad x\in [0,L]
        {\thinspace .}
        

This load is not symmetric
with respect to the midpoint :math:`x=L/2` so the solution loses its symmetry
and we must solve the scaled problem

.. math::
         u'' =\left\lbrace\begin{array}{ll}
        1, & x <1/2,\\ 
        0, & x \geq 1/2

Exercise 7: Show equivalence between linear systems
---------------------------------------------------

Incorporation of Dirichlet conditions at :math:`x=0` and :math:`x=L`
in a finite element mesh on :math:`\Omega=[0,L]` can either be done by
introducing an expansion :math:`u(x)=U_0{\varphi}_0 + U_{N_n-1}{\varphi}_{N_n-1} +
\sum_{j=0}^{N} c_j{\varphi}_{\nu(j)}`,
with :math:`N=N_n-3` and considering :math:`u` values at the
inner nodes as unknowns, *or*
one can assemble the matrix system with :math:`u(x)=\sum_{j=0}^{N=N_n-1}
c_j{\varphi}_j` and afterwards replace the rows corresponding to known
:math:`c_j` values by the boundary conditions.
Show that the two approaches are equivalent.

Exercise 8: Compute with a non-uniform mesh
-------------------------------------------

Derive the linear system for the problem :math:`-u''=2` on :math:`[0,1]`,
with :math:`u(0)=0` and :math:`u(1)=1`, using P1 elements and a *non-uniform*
mesh. The vertices have coordinates :math:`x_{0}=0 < x_{1} <\cdots <
x_{N_n-1}=1`,
and the length of cell number :math:`e` is :math:`h_e = x_{e+1} -x_{e}`.

It is of interest to compare the discrete equations for the finite element
method in a non-uniform mesh with the corresponding discrete equations
arising from a finite difference method. Go through the
derivation of
the finite difference formula :math:`u''(x_i) \approx [D_x D_x u]_i` and
modify it to find a natural discretization of :math:`u''(x_i)` on a non-uniform
mesh.

The following scaled 1D problem is a very simple, yet relevant, model
for convective transport in fluids:

        u' = \epsilon u'' ,\quad u(0)=0,\ u(1)=1,\ x\in [0,1]

Exercise 10: Compare finite elements and differences for a radially symmetric Poisson equation
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We consider the Poisson problem in a disk with radius :math:`R` with
Dirichlet conditions at the boundary.
Given that the solution is radially symmetric and hence dependent only on
the radial coordinate (:math:`r=\sqrt{x^2+y^2}`), we can reduce the problem
to a 1D Poisson equation

.. _Eq:fem:deq:exer:1D:Poisson:polar:eq:

.. math::
   :label: fem:deq:exer:1D:Poisson:polar:eq
        
        -\frac{1}{r}\frac{d}{dr}\left( r\frac{du}{dr}\right) = f(r),\quad r\in (0,R),\ 
        u'(0)=0,\ u(R)=U_R
        {\thinspace .}
        
        

**a)**
Derive a variational form of :eq:`fem:deq:exer:1D:Poisson:polar:eq`
by integrating over the whole disk, or posed equivalently: use
a weighting function :math:`2\pi r v(r)` and integrate :math:`r` from :math:`0` to :math:`R`.

**b)**
Use a uniform mesh partition with P1 elements and show what the
resulting set of equations becomes. Integrate the matrix entries
exact by hand, but use a Trapezoidal rule to integrate the :math:`f` term.

**c)**
Explain that an intuitive
finite difference method applied to :eq:`fem:deq:exer:1D:Poisson:polar:eq`
gives

.. math::
        
        \frac{1}{r_i}\frac{1}{h^2}\left( r_{i+\frac{1}{2}}(u_{i+1}-u_i) -
        r_{i-\frac{1}{2}}(u_{i}-u_{i-1})\right) = f_i,\quad i=rh
        {\thinspace .}
        

For :math:`i=0` the factor :math:`1/r_i` seemingly becomes problematic. One must always
have :math:`u'(0)=0`, because of the radial symmetry, which implies
:math:`u_{-1}=u_1`, if we allow introduction of a fictitious value :math:`u_{-1}`.
Using this :math:`u_{-1}` in the difference equation for :math:`i=0` gives

.. math::
        
        &\frac{1}{r_0}\frac{1}{h^2}\left( r_{\frac{1}{2}}(u_{1}-u_0) -
        r_{-\frac{1}{2}}(u_{0}-u_{1})\right) = \\ 
        & \qquad
        \frac{1}{r_0}\frac{1}{2h^2}\left( (r_0 + r_1)(u_{1}-u_0) -
        (r_{-1} + r_0)(u_{0}-u_{1})\right) \approx
        2(u_1-u_0),
        

if we use :math:`r_{-1}+r_1\approx 2r_0`.

Set up the complete set of equations for the finite difference method
and compare to the finite element method in case a Trapezoidal rule
is used to integrate the :math:`f` term in the latter method.

Exercise 11: Compute with variable coefficients and P1 elements by hand
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Consider the problem

.. math::
   :label: fem:deq:1D:model4
        
        -\frac{d}{dx}\left( {\alpha}(x)\frac{du}{dx}\right) + \gamma u = f(x),
        \quad x\in\Omega=[0,L],\quad u(0)={\alpha},\ u'(L)=\beta{\thinspace .}
        
        

We choose :math:`{\alpha}(x)=1+x^2`. Then

.. math::
         u(x) = {\alpha} + \beta(1+L^2)\tan^{-1}(x),
        

is an exact solution if :math:`f(x) = \gamma u`.

Derive a variational formulation and compute general expressions for the
element matrix and vector in an arbitrary element, using P1 elements
and a uniform partitioning of :math:`[0,L]`. The right-hand side
integral is challenging and can be computed by a numerical integration

Exercise 12: Solve a 2D Poisson equation using polynomials and sines
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The classical problem of applying a torque to the ends of a rod
can be modeled by a Poisson equation defined in the cross section :math:`\Omega`:

.. math::
         -\nabla^2 u = 2,\quad (x,y)\in\Omega,

with :math:`u=0` on :math:`\partial\Omega`. Exactly the same problem arises for
the deflection of a membrane with shape :math:`\Omega` under a constant load.

For a circular cross section one can readily
find an analytical solution. For a rectangular cross section the analytical
approach ends up with a sine series. The idea in this exercise is to
use a single basis function to obtain an approximate answer.

We assume for simplicity that the cross section is the unit square:
:math:`\Omega = [0,1]\times [0,1]`.

**a)**
We consider the basis
:math:`{\psi}_{p,q}(x,y) = \sin((p+1)\pi x)\sin (q\pi y)`, :math:`p,q=0,\ldots,n`.
These basis functions fulfill the Dirichlet condition.
Use a Galerkin method and :math:`n=0`.

**b)**
The basis function involving sine functions are orthogonal.
Use this property in the Galerkin method
to derive the coefficients :math:`c_{p,q}` in a
formula :math:`u=\sum_p\sum_q c_{p,q}{\psi}_{p,q}(x,y)`.

**c)**
Another possible basis is
:math:`{\psi}_i(x,y) = (x(1-x)y(1-y))^{i+1}`, :math:`i=0,\ldots,N`.
Use the Galerkin method to compute the solution for :math:`N=0`.
Which choice of a single basis function is best,
:math:`u\sim x(1-x)y(1-y)` or :math:`u\sim \sin(\pi x)\sin(\pi y)`?
In order to answer the question,
it is necessary to search the web or the literature for an accurate
estimate of the maximum :math:`u` value at :math:`x=y=1/2`.
