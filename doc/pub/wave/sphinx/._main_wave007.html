<p>This section presents a range of wave equation models
for different physical phenomena. Although many wave motion problems
in physics can be modeled by the standard linear wave equation, or a similar
formulation with a system of first-order equations, there are some
exceptions. Perhaps the most important is water waves: these are modeled by
the Laplace equation with time-dependent boundary conditions at
the water surface (long water waves, however, can be approximated
by a standard wave equation, see the section <a class="reference internal" href="._main_wave008.html#wave-app-sw-2d"><span class="std std-ref">The linear shallow water equations</span></a>).
Quantum mechanical waves constitute another example where the waves
are governed by the
Schrodinger
equation, i.e., not by a standard wave equation.
Many wave phenomena also need to take nonlinear effects into account
when the wave amplitude is significant. Shock waves in the air is
a primary example.</p>
<p>The derivations in the following are very brief. Those with a firm
background in continuum mechanics will probably have enough
information to fill in the details, while other readers will hopefully
get some impression of the physics and approximations involved when
establishing wave equation models.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="caption-text"><em>Discrete string model with point masses connected by elastic strings</em></span></p>
</div>
<p>Figure <a class="reference internal" href="#wave-app-string-fig"><span class="std std-ref">Discrete string model with point masses connected by elastic strings</span></a> shows a model we may use to derive
the equation for waves on a string. The string is modeled as a
set of discrete point masses (at mesh points) with
elastic strings in between. The string has a large constant tension <span class="math">\(T\)</span>.
We let the mass at mesh point <span class="math">\(x_i\)</span> be <span class="math">\(m_i\)</span>. The displacement of
this mass point in <span class="math">\(y\)</span> direction is denoted by <span class="math">\(u_i(t)\)</span>.</p>
<p>The motion of mass <span class="math">\(m_i\)</span> is governed by Newton&#8217;s second law of motion.
The position of the mass at time <span class="math">\(t\)</span> is <span class="math">\(x_i\boldsymbol{i} + u_i(t)\boldsymbol{j}\)</span>, where
<span class="math">\(\boldsymbol{i}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\boldsymbol{j}\)</span> are unit vectors in the <span class="math">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math">\(y\)</span> direction, respectively.
The acceleration is then <span class="math">\(u_i''(t)\boldsymbol{j}\)</span>. Two forces are acting
on the mass as indicated in Figure <a class="reference internal" href="#wave-app-string-fig"><span class="std std-ref">Discrete string model with point masses connected by elastic strings</span></a>.
The force <span class="math">\(\boldsymbol{T}^{-}\)</span> acting toward the point <span class="math">\(x_{i-1}\)</span> can be decomposed
as</p>
<div class="math">
\[\boldsymbol{T}^{-} = -T\sin\phi\boldsymbol{i} -T\cos\phi\boldsymbol{j},\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(\phi\)</span> is the angle between the force and the
line <span class="math">\(x=x_i\)</span>. Let <span class="math">\(\Delta u_i = u_i - u_{i-1}\)</span> and let
<span class="math">\(\Delta s_i = \sqrt{\Delta u_i^2 + (x_i - x_{i-1})^2}\)</span>
be the distance from mass <span class="math">\(m_{i-1}\)</span> to mass <span class="math">\(m_i\)</span>.
It is seen that <span class="math">\(\cos\phi = \Delta u_i/\Delta s_i\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\sin\phi =
(x_{i}-x_{i-1})/\Delta s\)</span> or <span class="math">\(\Delta x/\Delta s_i\)</span> if we
introduce a constant mesh spacing <span class="math">\(\Delta x = x_i - x_{i-1}\)</span>.
The force can then be written</p>
<div class="math">
\[\boldsymbol{T}^{-} = -T\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta s_i}\boldsymbol{i} - T\frac{\Delta u_i}{\Delta s_i}\boldsymbol{j}
{\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>The force <span class="math">\(\boldsymbol{T}^{+}\)</span> acting toward <span class="math">\(x_{i+1}\)</span> can be calculated in a similar way:</p>
<div class="math">
\[\boldsymbol{T}^{+} = T\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta s_{i+1}}\boldsymbol{i} +
            T\frac{\Delta u_{i+1}}{\Delta s_{i+1}}\boldsymbol{j}
{\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>Newton&#8217;s second law becomes</p>
<div class="math">
\[m_iu_i''(t)\boldsymbol{j} = \boldsymbol{T}^{+} + \boldsymbol{T}^{-},\]</div>
<p>which gives the component equations</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-wave:app:string:hcomp">
<span id="eq-wave-app-string-hcomp"></span><span class="eqno">(1)</span>\[     T\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta s_i} = T\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta s_{i+1}},\]</div>
<div class="math" id="equation-wave:app:string:vcomp">
<span id="eq-wave-app-string-vcomp"></span><span class="eqno">(2)</span>\[     m_iu_i''(t) = T\frac{\Delta u_{i+1}}{\Delta s_{i+1}} -
                    T\frac{\Delta u_i}{\Delta s_i}\]\[     {\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>A basic reasonable assumption for a string
is small displacements <span class="math">\(u_i\)</span> and small
displacement gradients <span class="math">\(\Delta u_i/\Delta x\)</span>. For small <span class="math">\(g=\Delta u_i/\Delta x\)</span>
we have that</p>
<div class="math">
\[\Delta s_i = \sqrt{\Delta u_i^2 + \Delta x^2} = \Delta x\sqrt{1 + g^2}
+ \Delta x (1 + {\frac{1}{2}}g^2 + {\cal O}(g^4) \approx \Delta x
{\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>Equation <a href="#equation-wave:app:string:hcomp">(1)</a> is then simply the identity <span class="math">\(T=T\)</span>, while
<a href="#equation-wave:app:string:vcomp">(2)</a> can be written as</p>
<div class="math">
\[m_iu_i''(t) = T\frac{\Delta u_{i+1}}{\Delta x} - T\frac{\Delta u_i}{\Delta x},\]</div>
<p>which upon division by <span class="math">\(\Delta x\)</span> and introducing the density
<span class="math">\(\varrho_i = m_i/\Delta x\)</span> becomes</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-wave:app:string:model0">
<span id="eq-wave-app-string-model0"></span><span class="eqno">(3)</span>\[     \varrho_i u_i''(t) = T\frac{1}{\Delta x^2}
     \left( u_{i+1} - 2u_i + u_{i-1}\right)\]\[     {\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>We can now choose to approximate <span class="math">\(u_i''\)</span> by a finite difference in time
and get the discretized wave equation,</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-_auto57">
<span id="eq-auto57"></span><span class="eqno">(4)</span>\[     \varrho_i \frac{1}{\Delta t^2}

     T\frac{1}{\Delta x^2}
     \left( u_{i+1} - 2u_i + u_{i-1}\right){\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>On the other hand, we may go to the continuum limit <span class="math">\(\Delta x\rightarrow 0\)</span> and
replace <span class="math">\(u_i(t)\)</span> by <span class="math">\(u(x,t)\)</span>, <span class="math">\(\varrho_i\)</span> by <span class="math">\(\varrho(x)\)</span>, and
recognize that the right-hand side of <a href="#equation-wave:app:string:model0">(3)</a>
approaches <span class="math">\(\partial^2 u/\partial x^2\)</span> as <span class="math">\(\Delta x\rightarrow 0\)</span>.
We end up with the continuous model for waves on a string:</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-wave:app:string:model1">
<span id="eq-wave-app-string-model1"></span><span class="eqno">(5)</span>\[     \varrho\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} = T\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}\]\[     {\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>Note that the density <span class="math">\(\varrho\)</span> may change along the string, while the
tension <span class="math">\(T\)</span> is a constant. With variable wave velocity <span class="math">\(c(x) = \sqrt{T/\varrho(x)}\)</span> we can write the wave equation in the more standard form</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-wave:app:string:model2">
<span id="eq-wave-app-string-model2"></span><span class="eqno">(6)</span>\[     \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} = c^2(x)\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}\]\[     {\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>Because of the way <span class="math">\(\varrho\)</span> enters the equations, the variable wave
velocity does <em>not</em> appear inside the derivatives as in many other
versions of the wave equation. However, most strings of interest have
constant <span class="math">\(\varrho\)</span>.</p>
<p>The end points of a string are fixed so that the displacement
<span class="math">\(u\)</span> is zero. The boundary conditions are therefore <span class="math">\(u=0\)</span>.</p>
<div class="section" id="damping">
<h3>Damping<a class="headerlink" href="#damping" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Air resistance and non-elastic effects in the string will contribute
to reduce the amplitudes of the waves so that the motion dies out
after some time. This damping effect can be modeled by a term
<span class="math">\(bu_t\)</span> on the left-hand side of the equation</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-wave:app:string:model1:damping">
<span id="eq-wave-app-string-model1-damping"></span><span class="eqno">(7)</span>\[     \varrho\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2}
     + b\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}  =  T\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}\]\[     {\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>The parameter <span class="math">\(b\geq 0\)</span> is small for most wave phenomena, but the
damping effect may become significant in long time simulations.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="external-forcing">
<h3>External forcing<a class="headerlink" href="#external-forcing" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>It is easy to include an external force acting on the string.
Say we have a vertical force <span class="math">\(\tilde f_i\boldsymbol{j}\)</span> acting on mass <span class="math">\(m_i\)</span>.
This force affects the vertical component of Newton&#8217;s law
and gives rise to an extra term <span class="math">\(\tilde f(x,t)\)</span> on the right-hand side of
<a href="#equation-wave:app:string:model1">(5)</a>. In the model
<a href="#equation-wave:app:string:model2">(6)</a> we would add a term
<span class="math">\(f(x,t) = \tilde f(x,y)/\varrho(x)\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="modeling-the-tension-via-springs">
<h3>Modeling the tension via springs<a class="headerlink" href="#modeling-the-tension-via-springs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>We assumed, in the derivation above, that the tension in the string, <span class="math">\(T\)</span>,
was constant. It is easy to check this assumption by modeling the
string segments between the masses as standard springs, where the
force (tension <span class="math">\(T\)</span>) is proportional to the elongation of the spring segment.
Let <span class="math">\(k\)</span> be the spring constant, and set <span class="math">\(T_i=k\Delta \ell\)</span> for the
tension in the spring segment between <span class="math">\(x_{i-1}\)</span> and <span class="math">\(x_i\)</span>, where
<span class="math">\(\Delta\ell\)</span> is the elongation of this segment from the tension-free state.
A basic feature of a string is that it has high tension in the
equilibrium position <span class="math">\(u=0\)</span>. Let the string segment have an elongation
<span class="math">\(\Delta\ell_0\)</span> in the equilibrium position. After deformation of the
string, the elongation is <span class="math">\(\Delta \ell = \Delta \ell_0 + \Delta s_i\)</span>:
<span class="math">\(T_i = k(\Delta \ell_0 + \Delta s_i)\approx k(\Delta \ell_0 + \Delta x)\)</span>.
This shows that <span class="math">\(T_i\)</span> is independent of <span class="math">\(i\)</span>. Moreover, the extra
approximate elongation <span class="math">\(\Delta x\)</span> is very small compared to <span class="math">\(\Delta\ell_0\)</span>,
so we may well set <span class="math">\(T_i = T = k\Delta\ell_0\)</span>. This means that
the tension is completely dominated by the initial tension determined
by the tuning of the string. The additional deformations of the
spring during the vibrations do not introduce significant changes in the
tension.</p>

<p>Seismic waves are used to infer properties of subsurface

<p>Here, <span class="math">\(\boldsymbol{u}\)</span> is the displacement field, <span class="math">\(\boldsymbol{\sigma}\)</span> is the stress tensor,

<p>Quite often in geological materials, the effective wave velocity

because geological layers are compacted, and often twisted, in such a

differ. With <span class="math">\(z\)</span> as the vertical coordinate, we can introduce a

<span id="wave-app-sound"></span><h2>Sound waves in liquids and gases<a class="headerlink" href="#sound-waves-in-liquids-and-gases" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Sound waves arise from pressure and density variations in fluids.
The starting point of modeling sound waves is the basic
equations for a compressible fluid where we omit viscous (frictional)
forces, body forces (gravity, for instance), and temperature effects:</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-wave:app:sound:cont">
<span id="eq-wave-app-sound-cont"></span><span class="eqno">(19)</span>\[     \varrho_t + \nabla\cdot (\varrho \boldsymbol{u}) = 0,\]</div>
<div class="math" id="equation-wave:app:sound:Euler">
<span id="eq-wave-app-sound-euler"></span><span class="eqno">(20)</span>\[     \varrho \boldsymbol{u}_{t} + \varrho \boldsymbol{u}\cdot\nabla\boldsymbol{u} = -\nabla p,\]</div>
<div class="math" id="equation-wave:app:sound:prho">
<span id="eq-wave-app-sound-prho"></span><span class="eqno">(21)</span>\[     \varrho = \varrho (p)
     {\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>These equations are often referred to as the Euler equations for the motion
of a fluid. The parameters involved are the density <span class="math">\(\varrho\)</span>,
the velocity <span class="math">\(\boldsymbol{u}\)</span>,
and the pressure <span class="math">\(p\)</span>. Equation <a href="#equation-wave:app:sound:Euler">(20)</a> reflects
mass balance, <a href="#equation-wave:app:sound:cont">(19)</a> is Newton&#8217;s second law for
a fluid, with frictional and body forces omitted, and
<a href="#equation-wave:app:sound:prho">(21)</a> is a constitutive law relating
density to pressure by thermodynamic considerations.
A typical model
for <a href="#equation-wave:app:sound:prho">(21)</a> is the so-called <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isentropic_process">isentropic relation</a>, valid for
adiabatic processes where there is no heat transfer:</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-wave:app:sound:prho:formula">
<span id="eq-wave-app-sound-prho-formula"></span><span class="eqno">(22)</span>\[     \varrho = \varrho_0\left(\frac{p}{p_0}\right)^{1/\gamma}
     {\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>Here, <span class="math">\(p_0\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\varrho_0\)</span> are references values for <span class="math">\(p\)</span> and <span class="math">\(\varrho\)</span> when the fluid is at rest, and
<span class="math">\(\gamma\)</span> is the ratio of specific heat at constant pressure and
constant volume (<span class="math">\(\gamma = 5/3\)</span> for air).</p>
<p>The key approximation in a mathematical model for sound waves is to
assume that these waves are small perturbations to the density, pressure,
and velocity. We therefore write</p>
<div class="math">
\[\begin{split}p &amp;= p_0 + \hat p,\\
\varrho &amp;= \varrho_0 + \hat\varrho,\\
\boldsymbol{u} &amp;= \hat\boldsymbol{u},\end{split}\]</div>
<p>where we have decomposed the fields in a constant
equilibrium value, corresponding
to <span class="math">\(\boldsymbol{u}=0\)</span>, and a small perturbation marked with a hat symbol.
By inserting these decompositions in <a href="#equation-wave:app:sound:cont">(19)</a> and
<a href="#equation-wave:app:sound:Euler">(20)</a>, neglecting all product terms of small
perturbations and/or their derivatives, and dropping the hat symbols,
one gets the following linearized PDE system for the small perturbations in
density, pressure, and velocity:</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-_auto59">
<span id="eq-auto59"></span><span class="eqno">(23)</span>\[     \varrho_t + \varrho_0\nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{u} = 0,\]</div>
<div class="math" id="equation-_auto60">
<span id="eq-auto60"></span><span class="eqno">(24)</span>\[     \varrho_0\boldsymbol{u}_t = -\nabla p
     {\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>Now we can eliminate <span class="math">\(\varrho_t\)</span> by differentiating the relation <span class="math">\(\varrho(p)\)</span>,</p>
<div class="math">
\[\varrho_t = \varrho_0 \frac{1}{\gamma}\left(\frac{p}{p_0}\right)^{1/\gamma-1}
\frac{1}{p_0}p_t = \frac{\varrho_0}{\gamma p_0}
\left(\frac{p}{p_0}\right)^{1/\gamma-1}p_t
{\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>The product term <span class="math">\(p^{1/\gamma -1}p_t\)</span> can be linearized as
<span class="math">\(p_0^{1/\gamma -1}p_t\)</span>, resulting in</p>
<div class="math">
\[\varrho_t \approx \frac{\varrho_0}{\gamma p_0} p_t
{\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>We then get</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-wave:app:sound:cont:pert">
<span id="eq-wave-app-sound-cont-pert"></span><span class="eqno">(25)</span>\[     p_t + \gamma p_0\nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{u} = 0,\]</div>
<div class="math" id="equation-wave:app:sound:Euler:pert">
<span id="eq-wave-app-sound-euler-pert"></span><span class="eqno">(26)</span>\[     \boldsymbol{u}_t = -\frac{1}{\varrho_0}\nabla p,\]\[     {\thinspace .}\]</div>
<p>Taking the divergence of <a href="#equation-wave:app:sound:Euler:pert">(26)</a> and
differentiating <a href="#equation-wave:app:sound:cont:pert">(25)</a> with respect to time
gives the possibility to easily eliminate <span class="math">\(\nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{u}_t\)</span> and
arrive at a standard, linear wave equation for <span class="math">\(p\)</span>:</p>
<div class="math" id="equation-_auto61">
<span id="eq-auto61"></span><span class="eqno">(27)</span>\[     p_{tt} = c^2\nabla^2 p,\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math">\(c = \sqrt{\gamma p_0/\varrho_0}\)</span> is the speed of sound in the fluid.</p>
