A very wide range of physical processes lead to wave motion, where
signals are propagated through a medium in space and time, normally
with little or no permanent movement of the medium itself.
The shape of the signals may undergo changes as they travel through
matter, but usually not so much that the signals cannot be recognized
at some later point in space and time.
Many types of wave motion can be described by the equation
:math:`u_{tt}=\nabla\cdot (c^2\nabla u) + f`, which we will solve
in the forthcoming text by finite difference methods.

Simulation of waves on a string
===============================

.. index::
   single: waves; on a string

.. index::
   single: wave equation; 1D

We begin our study of wave equations by simulating one-dimensional
waves on a string, say on a guitar or violin.
Let the string in the deformed state
coincide with the interval
:math:`[0,L]` on the :math:`x` axis, and let :math:`u(x,t)` be the displacement at
time :math:`t` in the :math:`y` direction of a point initially at :math:`x`.
The displacement function :math:`u` is governed by the mathematical model

.. _Eq:wave:pde1:

.. math::
   :label: wave:pde1
        
        \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} =
        c^2 \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}, \quad x\in (0,L),\ t\in (0,T]
        
        

.. _Eq:wave:pde1:ic:u:

.. math::
   :label: wave:pde1:ic:u
          
        u(x,0) = I(x), \quad x\in [0,L]
        
        

.. _Eq:wave:pde1:ic:ut:

.. math::
   :label: wave:pde1:ic:ut
          
        \frac{\partial}{\partial t}u(x,0) = 0, \quad x\in [0,L]
        
        

.. _Eq:wave:pde1:bc:0:

.. math::
   :label: wave:pde1:bc:0
          
        u(0,t)  = 0, \quad  t\in (0,T]
        
        

.. _Eq:wave:pde1:bc:L:

.. math::
   :label: wave:pde1:bc:L
          
        u(L,t)  = 0, \quad  t\in (0,T]
        
        

The constant :math:`c` and the function :math:`I(x)` must be prescribed.

Equation :eq:`wave:pde1` is known as the one-dimensional
*wave equation*. Since this PDE contains a second-order derivative
in time, we need *two initial conditions*. The condition
:eq:`wave:pde1:ic:u` specifies
the initial shape of the string, :math:`I(x)`, and
:eq:`wave:pde1:ic:ut` expresses that the initial velocity of the
string is zero. In addition, PDEs need *boundary conditions*, give here as
:eq:`wave:pde1:bc:0` and :eq:`wave:pde1:bc:L`. These two
conditions specify that
the string is fixed at the ends, i.e., that the displacement :math:`u` is zero.

The solution :math:`u(x,t)` varies in space and time and describes waves that
move with velocity :math:`c` to the left and right.

Sometimes we will use a more compact notation for the partial derivatives
to save space:

.. math::
        
        u_t = \frac{\partial u}{\partial t}, \quad
        u_{tt} = \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2},
        

and similar expressions
for derivatives with respect to other variables. Then the
wave equation can be written compactly as :math:`u_{tt} = c^2u_{xx}`.

.. index::
   single: wave equation; 1D, finite difference method

The PDE problem :eq:`wave:pde1`-:eq:`wave:pde1:bc:L` will now be
discretized in space and time by a finite difference method.

.. index::
   single: mesh; finite differences

.. _wave:string:mesh:

Discretizing the domain
-----------------------

The temporal domain :math:`[0,T]` is represented by a finite number of mesh points

.. math::
        
        0 = t_0 < t_1 < t_2 < \cdots < t_{N_t-1} < t_{N_t} = T {\thinspace .}  

Similarly, the spatial domain :math:`[0,L]` is replaced by a set of mesh points

.. math::
        
        0 = x_0 < x_1 < x_2 < \cdots < x_{N_x-1} < x_{N_x} = L {\thinspace .}  

One may view the mesh as two-dimensional in the :math:`x,t` plane, consisting
of points :math:`(x_i, t_n)`, with :math:`i=0,\ldots,N_x` and :math:`n=0,\ldots,N_t`.

Uniform meshes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For uniformly distributed mesh points we can introduce the constant
mesh spacings :math:`\Delta t` and :math:`\Delta x`. We have that

.. math::
        
        x_i = i\Delta x,\ i=0,\ldots,N_x,\quad
        t_n = n\Delta t,\ n=0,\ldots,N_t{\thinspace .}
        

We also have that :math:`\Delta x = x_i-x_{i-1}`, :math:`i=1,\ldots,N_x`, and
:math:`\Delta t = t_n - t_{n-1}`, :math:`n=1,\ldots,N_t`. Figure :ref:`wave:pde1:fig:mesh`
displays a mesh in the :math:`x,t` plane with :math:`N_t=5`, :math:`N_x=5`, and constant
mesh spacings.

.. _wave:string:numerical:sol:

The discrete solution
---------------------

.. index::
   single: stencil; 1D wave equation

.. index:: mesh function

The solution :math:`u(x,t)` is sought at the mesh points. We introduce
the mesh function :math:`u_i^n`, which approximates the exact
solution at the
mesh point :math:`(x_i,t_n)` for :math:`i=0,\ldots,N_x` and :math:`n=0,\ldots,N_t`.
Using the finite difference method, we shall
develop algebraic equations for computing the mesh function.

.. _wave:string:samplingPDE:

Fulfilling the equation at the mesh points
------------------------------------------

In the finite difference method, we relax
the condition that :eq:`wave:pde1` holds at all points in
the space-time domain :math:`(0,L)\times (0,T]` to the requirement that the PDE is
fulfilled at the *interior* mesh points only:

.. _Eq:wave:pde1:step2:

.. math::
   :label: wave:pde1:step2
        
        \frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2} u(x_i, t_n) =
        c^2\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} u(x_i, t_n),
        
        

for :math:`i=1,\ldots,N_x-1` and :math:`n=1,\ldots,N_t-1`. For :math:`n=0` we have
the initial conditions :math:`u=I(x)` and :math:`u_t=0`,
and at the boundaries :math:`i=0,N_x` we
have the boundary condition :math:`u=0`.

.. _wave:string:fd:

Replacing derivatives by finite differences
-------------------------------------------

The second-order derivatives can be replaced by central
differences. The most widely used difference approximation of
the second-order derivative is

.. math::
         \frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2}u(x_i,t_n)\approx
        \frac{u_i^{n+1} - 2u_i^n + u^{n-1}_i}{\Delta t^2}{\thinspace .}

It is convenient to introduce the finite difference operator notation

.. math::
         [D_tD_t u]^n_i = \frac{u_i^{n+1} - 2u_i^n + u^{n-1}_i}{\Delta t^2}{\thinspace .}

A similar approximation of the second-order derivative in the :math:`x`
direction reads

.. math::
         \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2}u(x_i,t_n)\approx
        \frac{u_{i+1}^{n} - 2u_i^n + u^{n}_{i-1}}{\Delta x^2} = [D_xD_x u]^n_i
        {\thinspace .}
        

Algebraic version of the PDE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We can now replace the derivatives in :eq:`wave:pde1:step2`
and get

.. _Eq:wave:pde1:step3b:

.. math::
   :label: wave:pde1:step3b
        
        \frac{u_i^{n+1} - 2u_i^n + u^{n-1}_i}{\Delta t^2} =
        c^2\frac{u_{i+1}^{n} - 2u_i^n + u^{n}_{i-1}}{\Delta x^2},
        
        

or written more compactly using the operator notation:

.. _Eq:wave:pde1:step3a:

.. math::
   :label: wave:pde1:step3a
        
        [D_tD_t u = c^2 D_xD_x]^{n}_i
        {\thinspace .}
        
        

Interpretation of the equation as a stencil
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A typical feature of :eq:`wave:pde1:step3b` is that it involves
:math:`u` values from neighboring points only:
:math:`u_i^{n+1}`, :math:`u^n_{i\pm 1}`, :math:`u^n_i`, and :math:`u^{n-1}_i`.
The circles in Figure
:ref:`wave:pde1:fig:mesh` illustrate such neighboring mesh points that
contributes to an algebraic equation. In this
particular case, we have sampled the PDE at the point :math:`(2,2)`
and constructed :eq:`wave:pde1:step3b`, which then
involves a coupling of :math:`u_2^1`, :math:`u_1^2`, :math:`u_2^2`, :math:`u_3^2`, and :math:`u_2^3`.
The term *stencil* is often used about the algebraic equation
at a mesh point, and the geometry of a typical stencil is
illustrated in Figure :ref:`wave:pde1:fig:mesh`. One also often refers
to the algebraic equations as *discrete equations*,
*(finite) difference equations* or a *finite difference
scheme*.

.. _wave:pde1:fig:mesh:

.. figure:: stencil_n_interior.png
   :width: 500

   *Mesh in space and time. The circles show points connected in a finite difference equation*

Algebraic version of the initial conditions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We also need to replace the derivative in the initial condition
:eq:`wave:pde1:ic:ut` by a finite difference approximation.
A centered difference of the type

.. math::
        
        \frac{\partial}{\partial t} u(x_i,t_n)\approx
        \frac{u^1_i - u^{-1}_i}{2\Delta t} = [D_{2t} u]^0_i,
        

seems appropriate. In operator notation the initial condition is
written as

.. math::
         [D_{2t} u]^n_i = 0,\quad n=0 {\thinspace .}  

Writing out this equation and ordering the terms give

.. _Eq:wave:pde1:step3c:

.. math::
   :label: wave:pde1:step3c
        
        u^{n-1}_i=u^{n+1}_i,\quad i=0,\ldots,N_x,\ n=0{\thinspace .}
        
        

The other initial condition can be computed by

.. math::
         u_i^0 = I(x_i),\quad i=0,\ldots,N_x{\thinspace .}

.. _wave:string:alg:

Formulating a recursive algorithm
---------------------------------

We assume that :math:`u^n_i` and
:math:`u^{n-1}_i` are already computed for :math:`i=0,\ldots,N_x`.
The only unknown quantity in :eq:`wave:pde1:step3b` is
therefore :math:`u^{n+1}_i`, which we can solve for:

.. _Eq:wave:pde1:step4:

.. math::
   :label: wave:pde1:step4
        
        u^{n+1}_i = -u^{n-1}_i + 2u^n_i + C^2
        \left(u^{n}_{i+1}-2u^{n}_{i} + u^{n}_{i-1}\right),
        
        

where we have introduced the parameter

.. math::
        
        C = c\frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x},
        

known as the *Courant number*.


.. admonition:: :math:`C` is the key parameter in the discrete wave equation

   We see that the
   discrete version of the PDE features only one parameter, :math:`C`,
   which is therefore the key parameter that governs the
   quality of the numerical solution (see the section :ref:`wave:pde1:analysis`
   for details). Both the primary
   physical parameter :math:`c` and the numerical parameters :math:`\Delta x` and :math:`\Delta t`
   are lumped together in :math:`C`. Note that :math:`C` is a dimensionless
   parameter.




Given that :math:`u^{n-1}_i` and :math:`u^n_i` are computed for :math:`i=0,\ldots,N_x`,
we find new values at the next time level by applying the formula
:eq:`wave:pde1:step4` for :math:`i=1,\ldots,N_x-1`. Figure
:ref:`wave:pde1:fig:mesh` illustrates the points that are used to
compute :math:`u^3_2`. For the boundary points, :math:`i=0` and :math:`i=N_x`, we apply
the boundary conditions :math:`u_i^{n+1}=0`.

A problem with :eq:`wave:pde1:step4` arises when :math:`n=0` since the
formula for :math:`u^1_i` involves :math:`u^{-1}_i`, which is an undefined
quantity outside the time mesh (and the time domain). However, we can
use the initial condition :eq:`wave:pde1:step3c` in combination with
:eq:`wave:pde1:step4` when :math:`n=0` to eliminate :math:`u^{-1}_i` and
arrive at a special formula for :math:`u_i^1`:

.. _Eq:wave:pde1:step4:1:

.. math::
   :label: wave:pde1:step4:1
        
        u_i^1 = u^0_i - \frac{1}{2}
        C^2\left(u^{0}_{i+1}-2u^{0}_{i} + u^{0}_{i-1}\right)
        {\thinspace .}
        
        

Figure :ref:`wave:pde1:fig:stencil:u1` illustrates how :eq:`wave:pde1:step4:1`
connects four instead of five points: :math:`u^1_2`, :math:`u_1^0`, :math:`u_2^0`, and :math:`u_3^0`.

.. _wave:pde1:fig:stencil:u1:

.. figure:: stencil_n0_interior.png
   :width: 500

   *Modified stencil for the first time step*

We can now summarize the computational algorithm:

1. Compute :math:`u^0_i=I(x_i)` for :math:`i=0,\ldots,N_x`

2. Compute :math:`u^1_i` by :eq:`wave:pde1:step4:1` and set :math:`u_i^1=0`
   for the boundary points :math:`i=0` and :math:`i=N_x`, for :math:`n=1,2,\ldots,N-1`,

3. For each time level :math:`n=1,2,\ldots,N_t-1`

  1. apply :eq:`wave:pde1:step4` to find :math:`u^{n+1}_i` for :math:`i=1,\ldots,N_x-1`

  2. set :math:`u^{n+1}_i=0` for the boundary points :math:`i=0`, :math:`i=N_x`.

The algorithm essentially consists of moving
a finite difference stencil through all the mesh points, which can be
seen as an animation in a `web page <http://tinyurl.com/opdfafk/pub/mov-wave/wave1D_PDE_Dirichlet_stencil_gpl/index.html>`__
or a `movie file <http://tinyurl.com/opdfafk/pub/mov-wave/wave1D_PDE_Dirichlet_stencil_gpl/movie.ogg>`__.

.. _wave:string:impl:

Sketch of an implementation
---------------------------

In a Python implementation of this algorithm, we use the array
elements ``u[i]`` to store :math:`u^{n+1}_i`, ``u_1[i]`` to store :math:`u^n_i`, and
``u_2[i]`` to store :math:`u^{n-1}_i`. Our naming convention is use ``u`` for the
unknown new spatial field to be computed, ``u_1`` as the solution at
one time step back in time, ``u_2`` as the solution two time steps back
in time and so forth.

The algorithm only involves the three most recent time levels, so we
need only three arrays for :math:`u_i^{n+1}`, :math:`u_i^n`, and :math:`u_i^{n-1}`,
:math:`i=0,\ldots,N_x`.  Storing all the solutions in a two-dimensional
array of size :math:`(N_x+1)\times (N_t+1)` would be possible in this simple
one-dimensional PDE problem, but is normally out of the question in
three-dimensional (3D) and large two-dimensional (2D) problems. We
shall therefore, in all our PDE solving programs, have the unknown in
memory at as few time levels as possible.

The following Python snippet realizes the steps in the computational
algorithm.

.. code-block:: python

        # Given mesh points as arrays x and t (x[i], t[n])
        dx = x[1] - x[0]
        dt = t[1] - t[0]
        C = c*dt/dx            # Courant number
        Nt = len(t)-1
        C2 = C**2              # Help variable in the scheme
        
        # Set initial condition u(x,0) = I(x)
        for i in range(0, Nx+1):
            u_1[i] = I(x[i])
        
        # Apply special formula for first step, incorporating du/dt=0
        for i in range(1, Nx):
            u[i] = u_1[i] - 0.5*C**2(u_1[i+1] - 2*u_1[i] + u_1[i-1])
        u[0] = 0;  u[Nx] = 0   # Enforce boundary conditions
        
        # Switch variables before next step
        u_2[:], u_1[:] = u_1, u
        
        for n in range(1, Nt):
            # Update all inner mesh points at time t[n+1]
            for i in range(1, Nx):
                u[i] = 2u_1[i] - u_2[i] - \ 
                       C**2(u_1[i+1] - 2*u_1[i] + u_1[i-1])
        
            # Insert boundary conditions
            u[0] = 0;  u[Nx] = 0
        
            # Switch variables before next step
            u_2[:], u_1[:] = u_1, u

Verification  (1)
=================

Before implementing the algorithm, it is convenient to add a source
term to the PDE :eq:`wave:pde1`
since it gives us more freedom in finding test problems for
verification. Physically, a source term acts as a generation of waves
in the interior of the domain.

.. _wave:pde2:fd:

A slightly generalized model problem
------------------------------------

We now address the following extended initial-boundary value problem
for one-dimensional wave phenomena:

.. _Eq:wave:pde2:

.. math::
   :label: wave:pde2
        
        u_{tt} = c^2 u_{xx} + f(x,t), \quad x\in (0,L),\ t\in (0,T]
        
        

.. _Eq:wave:pde2:ic:u:

.. math::
   :label: wave:pde2:ic:u
          
        u(x,0) = I(x), \quad x\in [0,L]
        
        

.. _Eq:wave:pde2:ic:ut:

.. math::
   :label: wave:pde2:ic:ut
          
        u_t(x,0) = V(x), \quad x\in [0,L]
        
        

.. _Eq:wave:pde2:bc:0:

.. math::
   :label: wave:pde2:bc:0
          
        u(0,t)  = 0, \quad  t>0
        
        

.. _Eq:wave:pde2:bc:L:

.. math::
   :label: wave:pde2:bc:L
          
        u(L,t)  = 0, \quad  t>0
        
        

Sampling the PDE at :math:`(x_i,t_n)` and using the same finite difference
approximations as above, yields

.. _Eq:wave:pde2:fdop:

.. math::
   :label: wave:pde2:fdop
        
        [D_tD_t u = c^2 D_xD_x u + f]^{n}_i
        {\thinspace .}
        
        

Writing this out and solving for the unknown :math:`u^{n+1}_i` results in

.. _Eq:wave:pde2:step3b:

.. math::
   :label: wave:pde2:step3b
        
        u^{n+1}_i = -u^{n-1}_i + 2u^n_i + C^2
        (u^{n}_{i+1}-2u^{n}_{i} + u^{n}_{i-1}) + \Delta t^2 f^n_i
        
        {\thinspace .}
        

The equation for the first time step must be rederived. The discretization
of the initial condition :math:`u_t = V(x)` at :math:`t=0`
becomes

.. math::
         [D_{2t}u = V]^0_i\quad\Rightarrow\quad u^{-1}_i = u^{1}_i - 2\Delta t V_i,

which, when inserted in :eq:`wave:pde2:step3b` for :math:`n=0`, gives
the special formula

.. _Eq:wave:pde2:step3c:

.. math::
   :label: wave:pde2:step3c
        
        u^{1}_i = u^0_i - \Delta t V_i + {\frac{1}{2}}
        C^2
        \left(u^{0}_{i+1}-2u^{0}_{i} + u^{0}_{i-1}\right) + \frac{1}{2}\Delta t^2 f^0_i
        
        {\thinspace .}
        

.. _wave:pde2:fd:standing:waves:

Using an analytical solution of physical significance
-----------------------------------------------------

Many wave problems feature sinusoidal oscillations in time
and space. For example, the original PDE problem
:eq:`wave:pde1`-:eq:`wave:pde1:bc:L` allows an exact solution

.. _Eq:wave:pde2:test:ue:

.. math::
   :label: wave:pde2:test:ue
        
        {u_{\small\mbox{e}}}(x,t)) = A\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{L}x\right)
        \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{L}ct\right){\thinspace .}
        
        

This :math:`{u_{\small\mbox{e}}}` fulfills the PDE with :math:`f=0`, boundary conditions
:math:`{u_{\small\mbox{e}}}(0,t)={u_{\small\mbox{e}}}(L,0)=0`, as well as initial
conditions :math:`I(x)=A\sin\left(\frac{\pi}{L}x\right)` and :math:`V=0`.

It is common to use such exact solutions of physical interest
to verify implementations. However, the numerical
solution :math:`u^n_i` will only be an approximation to :math:`{u_{\small\mbox{e}}}(x_i,t_n)`.
We have no knowledge of the precise size of the error in
this approximation, and therefore we can never know if discrepancies
between :math:`u^n_i` and :math:`{u_{\small\mbox{e}}}(x_i,t_n)` are caused
by mathematical approximations or programming errors.
In particular, if a plot of the computed solution :math:`u^n_i` and
the exact one \eq:ref:`wave:pde2:test:ue` looks similar, many
are tempted to claim that the implementation works. However,
even if color plots look nice and the accuracy is "deemed good",
there can still be serious programming errors present!

The only way to use exact physical solutions like
:eq:`wave:pde2:test:ue` for serious and thorough verification is to
run a series of finer and finer meshes, measure the integrated error
in each mesh, and from this information estimate the empirical convergence
rate of the method.
An introduction to the computing convergence rates is given in
the section
on `convergence rates <http://hplgit.github.io/decay-book/doc/pub/book/sphinx/._book007.html#computing-convergence-rates>`__ in [Ref1]_.

In the present problem, one expects the method to have a convergence rate
of 2 (see the section :ref:`wave:pde1:analysis`), so if the computed rates
are close to 2 on a sufficiently mesh, we have good evidence that
the implementation is free of programming mistakes.

Manufactured solution
---------------------

One problem with the exact solution :eq:`wave:pde2:test:ue` is
that it requires a simplification (:math:`V=0, f=0`) of the implemented problem
:eq:`wave:pde2`-:eq:`wave:pde2:bc:L`. An advantage of using
a *manufactured solution* is that we can test all terms in the
PDE problem. The idea of this approach is to set up some chosen
solution and fit the source term, boundary conditions, and initial
conditions to be compatible with the chosen solution.
Given that our boundary conditions in the implementation are
:math:`u(0,t)=u(L,t)=0`, we must choose a solution that fulfills these
conditions. One example is

.. math::
         {u_{\small\mbox{e}}}(x,t) = x(L-x)\sin t{\thinspace .}

Inserted in the PDE :math:`u_{tt}=c^2u_{xx}+f` we get

.. math::
         -x(L-x)\sin t = -c^2 2\sin t + f\quad\Rightarrow f = (2c^2 - x(L-x))\sin t{\thinspace .}

The initial conditions become

.. math::
        
        u(x,0) =& I(x) = 0,\\ 
        u_t(x,0) &= V(x) = x(L-x){\thinspace .}
        

To verify the code, we compute the convergence rates in a series of
simulations, letting each simulation use a finer mesh than the
previous one. Such empirical estimation of convergence rates
tests rely on an assumption that some
measure :math:`E` of the numerical error is related to the discretization
parameters through

.. math::
         E = C_t\Delta t^r + C_x\Delta x^p,

where :math:`C_t`, :math:`C_x`, :math:`r`, and :math:`p` are constants. The constants
:math:`r` and :math:`p` are known as the *convergence rates* in time and space,
respectively.
From the
accuracy in the finite difference approximations, we expect :math:`r=p=2`,
since the error terms are of order :math:`\Delta t^2` and :math:`\Delta x^2`.
This is confirmed by truncation error analysis and other types of analysis.

By using an exact solution of the PDE problem, we will next compute
the error measure :math:`E` on a sequence of refined meshes and see if
the rates :math:`r=p=2` are obtained. We will not be concerned with estimating
the constants :math:`C_t` and :math:`C_x`.

It is advantageous to introduce a single discretization parameter
:math:`h=\Delta t=\hat c \Delta x` for some constant :math:`\hat c`.
Since :math:`\Delta t` and :math:`\Delta x`
are related through the Courant number, :math:`\Delta t = C\Delta x/c`, we
set :math:`h=\Delta t`, and then :math:`\Delta x = hc/C`.
Now the expression for the error measure is greatly simplified:

.. math::
         E = C_t\Delta t^r + C_x\Delta x^r = C_t h^r + C_x\left(\frac{c}{C}\right)^r h^r
        = Dh^r,\quad D = C_t+C_x\left(\frac{c}{C}\right)^r {\thinspace .}

We choose an initial discretization parameter :math:`h_0` and run
experiments with decreasing :math:`h`: :math:`h_i=2^{-i}h_0`, :math:`i=1,2,\ldots,m`.
Halving :math:`h` in each experiment is not necessary, but it is a common choice.
For each experiment we must record :math:`E` and :math:`h`.
A standard choice of error measure
is the :math:`\ell^2` or :math:`\ell^\infty` norm of
the error mesh function :math:`e^n_i`:

.. math::
        
        E = ||e^n_i||_{\ell^2} = \left( \Delta t\Delta x\sum_{n=0}^{N_t}\sum_{i=0}^{N_x}
        (e^n_i)^2\right)^{\frac{1}{2}},\quad e^n_i = {u_{\small\mbox{e}}}(x_i,t_n)-u^n_i,
        
        

.. math::
          
        E = ||e^n_i||_{\ell^\infty} = \max_{i,n} |e^i_n|{\thinspace .}
        

In Python, one can compute :math:`\sum_{i}(e^{n}_i)^2` at each time step
and accumulate the value in some sum variable, say ``e2_sum``.  At the
final time step one can do ``sqrt(dt*dx*e2_sum)``.  For the
:math:`\ell^\infty` norm one must compare the maximum error at a time level
(``e.max()``) with the global maximum over the time domain: ``e_max =
max(e_max, e.max())``.

An alternative error measure
is to use a spatial norm at one time step only, e.g.,
the end time :math:`T` (:math:`n=N_t`):

.. math::
        
        E = ||e^n_i||_{\ell^2} = \left( \Delta x\sum_{i=0}^{N_x}
        (e^n_i)^2\right)^{\frac{1}{2}},\quad e^n_i = {u_{\small\mbox{e}}}(x_i,t_n)-u^n_i,
        
        

.. math::
          
        E = ||e^n_i||_{\ell^\infty} = \max_{0\leq i\leq N_x} |e^{n}_i|{\thinspace .}
        

The important issue is that our error measure :math:`E` must be one number
that represents the error in the simulation.

Let :math:`E_i` be the error measure in experiment (mesh) number :math:`i` and
let :math:`h_i` be the corresponding discretization parameter (:math:`h`).
With the error model :math:`E_i = Dh_i^r`, we can
estimate :math:`r` by comparing two consecutive
experiments:

.. math::
        
        E_{i+1}& =D h_{i+1}^{r},\\ 
        E_{i}& =D h_{i}^{r}{\thinspace .}
        

Dividing the two equations eliminates the (uninteresting) constant :math:`D`.
Thereafter, solving for :math:`r` yields

.. math::
         r = \frac{\ln E_{i+1}/E_{i}}{\ln h_{i+1}/h_{i}}{\thinspace .}
        

Since :math:`r` depends on :math:`i`, i.e., which simulations we compare,
we add an index to :math:`r`: :math:`r_i`, where :math:`i=0,\ldots,m-2`, if we
have :math:`m` experiments: :math:`(h_0,E_0),\ldots,(h_{m-1}, E_{m-1})`.

In our present discretization of the wave equation we expect :math:`r=2`, and
hence the :math:`r_i` values should converge to 2 as :math:`i` increases.

Constructing an exact solution of the discrete equations
--------------------------------------------------------

With a manufactured or known analytical solution, as outlined above,
we can estimate convergence rates and see if they have the correct
asymptotic behavior. Experience shows that this is a quite good
verification technique in that many common bugs will destroy the
convergence rates. A significantly better test though,
would be to check that the
numerical solution is exactly what it should be. This will in general
require exact knowledge of the numerical error, which we do not normally have
(although we in the section :ref:`wave:pde1:analysis` establish such knowledge
in simple cases).
However, it is possible to look for solutions where we can show that
the numerical error vanishes, i.e., the solution of the original continuous
PDE problem is
also a solution of the discrete equations. This property often arises
if the exact solution of the PDE
is a lower-order polynomial. (Truncation error
analysis leads to error measures that involve derivatives of the
exact solution. In the present problem, the truncation error involves
4th-order derivatives of :math:`u` in space and time. Choosing :math:`u`
as a polynomial of degree three or less
will therefore lead to vanishing error.)

We shall now illustrate the construction of an exact solution to both the
PDE itself and the discrete equations.
Our chosen manufactured solution is quadratic in space
and linear in time. More specifically, we set

.. _Eq:wave:pde2:fd:verify:quadratic:uex:

.. math::
   :label: wave:pde2:fd:verify:quadratic:uex
        
        {u_{\small\mbox{e}}} (x,t) = x(L-x)(1+{\frac{1}{2}}t),
        
        

which by insertion in the PDE leads to :math:`f(x,t)=2(1+t)c^2`. This :math:`{u_{\small\mbox{e}}}`
fulfills the boundary conditions :math:`u=0` and demands :math:`I(x)=x(L-x)`
and :math:`V(x)={\frac{1}{2}}x(L-x)`.

To realize that the chosen :math:`{u_{\small\mbox{e}}}` is also an exact
solution of the discrete equations,
we first remind ourselves that :math:`t_n=n\Delta t` before we
establish that

.. math::
        
        \lbrack D_tD_t t^2\rbrack^n = \frac{t_{n+1}^2 - 2t_n^2 + t_{n-1}^2}{\Delta t^2}
        = (n+1)^2 -2n^2 + (n-1)^2 = 2,
        

.. math::
          
        \lbrack D_tD_t t\rbrack^n = \frac{t_{n+1} - 2t_n + t_{n-1}}{\Delta t^2}
        = \frac{((n+1) -2n + (n-1))\Delta t}{\Delta t^2} = 0
        {\thinspace .}
        

Hence,

.. math::
         [D_tD_t {u_{\small\mbox{e}}}]^n_i = x_i(L-x_i)[D_tD_t (1+{\frac{1}{2}}t)]^n =
        x_i(L-x_i){\frac{1}{2}}[D_tD_t t]^n = 0{\thinspace .}

Similarly, we get that

.. math::
        
        \lbrack D_xD_x {u_{\small\mbox{e}}}\rbrack^n_i &=
        (1+{\frac{1}{2}}t_n)\lbrack D_xD_x (xL-x^2)\rbrack_i =
        (1+{\frac{1}{2}}t_n)\lbrack LD_xD_x x - D_xD_x x^2\rbrack_i \\ 
        &= -2(1+{\frac{1}{2}}t_n)
        {\thinspace .}
        

Now, :math:`f^n_i = 2(1+{\frac{1}{2}}t_n)c^2`, which results in

.. math::
         [D_tD_t {u_{\small\mbox{e}}} - c^2D_xD_x{u_{\small\mbox{e}}} - f]^n_i = 0 - c^2(-1)2(1 + {\frac{1}{2}}t_n
        + 2(1+{\frac{1}{2}}t_n)c^2 = 0{\thinspace .}

Moreover, :math:`{u_{\small\mbox{e}}}(x_i,0)=I(x_i)`,
:math:`\partial {u_{\small\mbox{e}}}/\partial t = V(x_i)` at :math:`t=0`, and
:math:`{u_{\small\mbox{e}}}(x_0,t)={u_{\small\mbox{e}}}(x_{N_x},0)=0`. Also the modified scheme for the
first time step is fulfilled by :math:`{u_{\small\mbox{e}}}(x_i,t_n)`.

Therefore, the exact solution :math:`{u_{\small\mbox{e}}}(x,t)=x(L-x)(1+t/2)`
of the PDE problem is also an exact solution of the discrete problem.
We can use this result to check that the computed :math:`u^n_i` values from
an implementation equals :math:`{u_{\small\mbox{e}}}(x_i,t_n)` within machine precision,
*regardless of the mesh spacings* :math:`\Delta x` and :math:`\Delta t`!
Nevertheless, there might be stability
restrictions on :math:`\Delta x` and :math:`\Delta t`, so the test can only be
run for a mesh that is compatible with the stability criterion (which
in the present case is :math:`C\leq 1`, to be derived later).


.. note::
   A product of quadratic or linear expressions in the various
   independent variables, as shown above, will often fulfill both the
   PDE problem and the discrete equations, and can therefore be very useful
   solutions for verifying implementations.  However, for 1D wave
   equations of the type :math:`u_t=c^2u_{xx}` we shall see that there is always
   another much more powerful way of generating exact
   solutions (which consists in just setting :math:`C=1` (!), as shown in
   the section :ref:`wave:pde1:analysis`).
