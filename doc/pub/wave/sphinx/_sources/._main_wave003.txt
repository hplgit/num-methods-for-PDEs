Generalization: reflecting boundaries
=====================================

The boundary condition :math:`u=0` makes :math:`u` change sign at the boundary,
while the condition :math:`u_x=0` perfectly reflects the wave, see
a `web page <http://tinyurl.com/k3sdbuv/pub/mov-wave/demo_BC_gaussian/index.html>`__
or a `movie file <http://tinyurl.com/k3sdbuv/pub/mov-wave/demo_BC_gaussian/movie.flv>`__
for demonstration.
Our next task is to explain how to implement the boundary
condition :math:`u_x=0`, which is
more complicated to express numerically and also to implement than
a given value of :math:`u`.
We shall present two methods for implementing :math:`u_x=0`
in a finite difference scheme, one based on deriving a modified
stencil at the boundary, and another one based on extending the mesh
with ghost cells and ghost points.

Neumann boundary condition
--------------------------

.. index:: Neumann conditions

.. index:: Dirichlet conditions

.. index:: homogeneous Neumann conditions

.. index:: homogeneous Dirichlet conditions

.. index::
   single: boundary conditions; Neumann

.. index::
   single: boundary conditions; Dirichlet

When a wave hits a boundary and is to be reflected back, one applies
the condition

.. _Eq:wave:pde1:Neumann:0:

.. math::
   :label: wave:pde1:Neumann:0
        
         \frac{\partial u}{\partial n} \equiv \boldsymbol{n}\cdot\nabla u = 0
        
        {\thinspace .}
        

The derivative :math:`\partial /\partial n` is in the
outward normal direction from a general boundary.
For a 1D domain :math:`[0,L]`,
we have that

.. math::
        
        \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial n}\right\vert_{x=L} =
        \frac{\partial}{\partial x},\quad
        \left.\frac{\partial}{\partial n}\right\vert_{x=0} = -
        \frac{\partial}{\partial x}{\thinspace .}
        


.. admonition:: Boundary condition terminology

   Boundary conditions
   that specify the value of :math:`\partial u/\partial n`,
   or shorter :math:`u_n`, are known as
   `Neumann <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neumann_boundary_condition>`__ conditions, while `Dirichlet conditions <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirichlet_conditions>`__
   refer to specifications of :math:`u`.
   When the values are zero (:math:`\partial u/\partial n=0` or :math:`u=0`) we speak
   about *homogeneous* Neumann or Dirichlet conditions.




.. _wave:pde2:Neumann:discr:

Discretization of derivatives at the boundary
---------------------------------------------

How can we incorporate the condition :eq:`wave:pde1:Neumann:0`
in the finite difference scheme?  Since we have used central
differences in all the other approximations to derivatives in the
scheme, it is tempting to implement :eq:`wave:pde1:Neumann:0` at
:math:`x=0` and :math:`t=t_n` by the difference

.. _Eq:wave:pde1:Neumann:0:cd:

.. math::
   :label: wave:pde1:Neumann:0:cd
        
        \frac{u_{-1}^n - u_1^n}{2\Delta x} = 0
        {\thinspace .}
        
        

The problem is that :math:`u_{-1}^n` is not a :math:`u` value that is being
computed since the point is outside the mesh. However, if we combine
:eq:`wave:pde1:Neumann:0:cd` with the scheme

.. :ref:`(2.10) <Eq:wave:pde1:step4>`

for :math:`i=0`,

.. _Eq:wave:pde1:Neumann:0:scheme:

.. math::
   :label: wave:pde1:Neumann:0:scheme
        
        u^{n+1}_i = -u^{n-1}_i + 2u^n_i + C^2
        \left(u^{n}_{i+1}-2u^{n}_{i} + u^{n}_{i-1}\right),
        
        

we can eliminate the fictitious value :math:`u_{-1}^n`. We see that
:math:`u_{-1}^n=u_1^n` from :eq:`wave:pde1:Neumann:0:cd`, which
can be used in :eq:`wave:pde1:Neumann:0:scheme` to
arrive at a modified scheme for the boundary point :math:`u_0^{n+1}`:

.. math::
        
        u^{n+1}_i = -u^{n-1}_i  + 2u^n_i + 2C^2
        \left(u^{n}_{i+1}-u^{n}_{i}\right),\quad i=0 {\thinspace .}  

Figure :ref:`wave:pde1:fig:Neumann:stencil` visualizes this equation
for computing :math:`u^3_0` in terms of :math:`u^2_0`, :math:`u^1_0`, and
:math:`u^2_1`.

.. index::
   single: stencil; Neumann boundary

.. _wave:pde1:fig:Neumann:stencil:

.. figure:: stencil_n_left.png
   :width: 500

   *Modified stencil at a boundary with a Neumann condition*

Similarly, :eq:`wave:pde1:Neumann:0` applied at :math:`x=L`
is discretized by a central difference

.. _Eq:wave:pde1:Neumann:0:cd2:

.. math::
   :label: wave:pde1:Neumann:0:cd2
        
        \frac{u_{N_x+1}^n - u_{N_x-1}^n}{2\Delta x} = 0
        {\thinspace .}
        
        

Combined with the scheme for :math:`i=N_x` we get a modified scheme for
the boundary value :math:`u_{N_x}^{n+1}`:

.. math::
        
        u^{n+1}_i = -u^{n-1}_i + 2u^n_i + 2C^2
        \left(u^{n}_{i-1}-u^{n}_{i}\right),\quad i=N_x {\thinspace .}  

The modification of the scheme at the boundary is also required for
the special formula for the first time step. How the stencil moves
through the mesh and is modified at the boundary can be illustrated
by an animation
in a `web page <http://tinyurl.com/k3sdbuv/pub/mov-wave/wave1D_PDE_Neumann_stencil_gpl/index.html>`__
or a `movie file <http://tinyurl.com/k3sdbuv/pub/mov-wave/wave1D_PDE_Neumann_stencil_gpl/movie.ogg>`__.

.. _wave:pde2:Neumann:impl:

Implementation of Neumann conditions
------------------------------------

The implementation of the special formulas for the boundary points
can benefit from using the general formula for the interior points
also at the boundaries,
but replacing :math:`u_{i-1}^n` by :math:`u_{i+1}^n` when computing
:math:`u_i^{n+1}` for :math:`i=0` and
:math:`u_{i+1}^n` by :math:`u_{i-1}^n` for :math:`i=N_x`. This is achieved by
just replacing the index
:math:`i-1` by :math:`i+1` for :math:`i=0` and :math:`i+1` by :math:`i-1` for
:math:`i=N_x`. In a program, we introduce variables to hold the value of
the offset indices: ``im1`` for ``i-1`` and ``ip1`` for ``i+1``.
It is now just a manner of defining ``im1`` and ``ip1`` properly
for the internal points and the boundary points.
The coding for the latter reads

.. code-block:: python

        i = 0
        ip1 = i+1
        im1 = ip1  # i-1 -> i+1
        u[i] = u_1[i] + C2*(u_1[im1] - 2*u_1[i] + u_1[ip1])
        
        i = Nx
        im1 = i-1
        ip1 = im1  # i+1 -> i-1
        u[i] = u_1[i] + C2*(u_1[im1] - 2*u_1[i] + u_1[ip1])

We can in fact create one loop over both the internal and boundary
points and use only one updating formula:

.. code-block:: python

        for i in range(0, Nx+1):
            ip1 = i+1 if i < Nx else i-1
            im1 = i-1 if i > 0  else i+1
            u[i] = u_1[i] + C2*(u_1[im1] - 2*u_1[i] + u_1[ip1])

The program `wave1D_n0.py <http://tinyurl.com/jvzzcfn/wave/wave1D/wave1D_n0.py>`__
contains a complete implementation of the 1D wave equation with
boundary conditions :math:`u_x = 0` at :math:`x=0` and :math:`x=L`.

It would be nice to modify the ``test_quadratic`` test case from the
``wave1D_u0.py`` with Dirichlet conditions, described in the section :ref:`wave:pde1:impl:vec:verify:quadratic`. However, the Neumann
conditions requires the polynomial variation in :math:`x` directory to
be of third degree, which causes challenging problems with
designing a test where the numerical solution is known exactly.
:ref:`wave:fd2:exer:verify:cubic` outlines ideas and code
for this purpose. The only test in ``wave1D_n0.py`` is to start
with a plug wave at rest and see that the initial condition is
reached again perfectly after one period of motion, if :math:`C=1`.

.. _wave:indexset:

Index set notation
------------------

.. index:: index set notation

We shall introduce a special notation for index sets, consisting of
writing :math:`x_i`, :math:`i\in{\mathcal{I}_x}`, instead of :math:`i=0,\ldots,N_x`.
Obviously, :math:`{\mathcal{I}_x}` must be the set :math:`{\mathcal{I}_x} =\{0,\ldots,N_x\}`, but it
is often advantageous to have a symbol for this set rather than
specifying all its elements. This saves writing and makes
specification of algorithms and implementation of computer code easier.

The first index in the set will be denoted :math:`{{\mathcal{I^0}_x}}`
and the last :math:`{\mathcal{I^{-1}_x}}`. Sometimes we need to count from the second
element in the set, and the notation :math:`{{\mathcal{I^+}_x}}` is then used.
Correspondingly, :math:`{{\mathcal{I^-}_x}}` means :math:`\{0,\ldots,N_x-1\}`.  All the
indices corresponding to inner grid points are
:math:`{{\mathcal{I^i}_x}}=\{1,\ldots,N_x-1\}`.  For the time domain we find it
natural to explicitly use 0 as the first index, so we will usually
write :math:`n=0` and :math:`t_0` rather than :math:`n={\mathcal{I}_t}^0`. We also avoid notation
like :math:`x_{{\mathcal{I^{-1}_x}}}` and will instead use :math:`x_i`, :math:`i={\mathcal{I^{-1}_x}}`.

The Python code associated with index sets applies the following
conventions:

==================  ============  
     Notation          Python     
==================  ============  
:math:`{\mathcal{I}_x}`         ``Ix``        
:math:`{{\mathcal{I^0}_x}}`  ``Ix[0]``     
:math:`{\mathcal{I^{-1}_x}}`  ``Ix[-1]``    
:math:`{{\mathcal{I^-}_x}}`  ``Ix[:-1]``   
:math:`{{\mathcal{I^+}_x}}`  ``Ix[1:]``    
:math:`{{\mathcal{I^i}_x}}`  ``Ix[1:-1]``  
==================  ============  

An important feature of the index set notation is that it
keeps our formulas and code independent of how
we count mesh points. For example, the notation :math:`i\in{\mathcal{I}_x}` or :math:`i={{\mathcal{I^0}_x}}`
remains the same whether :math:`{\mathcal{I}_x}` is defined as above or as starting at 1,
i.e., :math:`{\mathcal{I}_x}=\{1,\ldots,Q\}`. Similarly, we can in the code define
``Ix=range(Nx+1)`` or ``Ix=range(1,Q)``, and expressions
like ``Ix[0]`` and ``Ix[1:-1]`` remain correct. One application where
the index set notation is convenient is
conversion of code from a language where arrays has base index 0 (e.g.,
Python and C) to languages where the base index is 1 (e.g., MATLAB and
Fortran). Another important application is implementation of
Neumann conditions via ghost points (see next section).

For the current problem setting in the :math:`x,t` plane, we work with
the index sets

.. math::
        
        {\mathcal{I}_x} = \{0,\ldots,N_x\},\quad {\mathcal{I}_t} = \{0,\ldots,N_t\},
        

defined in Python as

.. code-block:: python

        Ix = range(0, Nx+1)
        It = range(0, Nt+1)

A finite difference scheme can with the index set notation be specified as

.. math::
        
        u^{n+1}_i &= -u^{n-1}_i  + 2u^n_i + C^2
        \left(u^{n}_{i+1}-2u^{n}_{i}+u^{n}_{i-1}\right),
        \quad i\in{{\mathcal{I^i}_x}},\ n\in{{\mathcal{I^i}_t}},\\ 
        u_i &= 0,
        \quad i={{\mathcal{I^0}_x}},\ n\in{{\mathcal{I^i}_t}},\\ 
        u_i &= 0,
        \quad i={\mathcal{I^{-1}_x}},\ n\in{{\mathcal{I^i}_t}},
        

and implemented by code like

.. code-block:: python

        for n in It[1:-1]:
            for i in Ix[1:-1]:
                u[i] = - u_2[i] + 2*u_1[i] + \ 
                       C2*(u_1[i-1] - 2*u_1[i] + u_1[i+1])
            i = Ix[0];  u[i] = 0
            i = Ix[-1]; u[i] = 0


.. note::
   The program `wave1D_dn.py <http://tinyurl.com/jvzzcfn/wave/wave1D/wave1D_dn.py>`__
   applies the index set notation and
   solves the 1D wave equation :math:`u_{tt}=c^2u_{xx}+f(x,t)` with
   quite general boundary and initial conditions:
   
     * :math:`x=0`: :math:`u=U_0(t)` or :math:`u_x=0`
   
     * :math:`x=L`: :math:`u=U_L(t)` or :math:`u_x=0`
   
     * :math:`t=0`: :math:`u=I(x)`
   
     * :math:`t=0`: :math:`u_t=I(x)`
   
   The program combines Dirichlet and Neumann conditions, scalar and vectorized
   implementation of schemes, and the index notation into one piece of code.
   A lot of test examples are also included in the program:
   
    * A rectangular plug profile as initial condition (easy to use as
      test example as the rectangle should jump one cell per time
      step when :math:`C=1`, without any numerical errors).
   
    * A Gaussian function as initial condition.
   
    * A triangular profile as initial condition, which resembles the
      typical initial shape of a guitar string.
   
    * A sinusoidal variation of :math:`u` at :math:`x=0` and either :math:`u=0` or
      :math:`u_x=0` at :math:`x=L`.
   
    * An exact analytical solution :math:`u(x,t)=\cos(m\pi t/L)\sin({\frac{1}{2}}m\pi x/L)`, which can be used for convergence rate tests.




.. _wave:pde1:Neumann:ghost:

Alternative implementation via ghost cells
------------------------------------------

Idea
~~~~

Instead of modifying the scheme at the boundary, we can introduce
extra points outside the domain such that the fictitious values
:math:`u_{-1}^n` and :math:`u_{N_x+1}^n`
are defined in the mesh.
Adding the intervals :math:`[-\Delta x,0]` and :math:`[L, L+\Delta x]`,
often referred to as *ghost cells*, to the mesh gives us all the
needed mesh points, corresponding to :math:`i=-1,0,\ldots,N_x,N_x+1`.
The extra points :math:`i=-1` and :math:`i=N_x+1` are known as *ghost points*,
and values at these points, :math:`u_{-1}^n` and :math:`u_{N_x+1}^n`, are
called *ghost values*.

The important idea is
to ensure that we always have

.. math::
         u_{-1}^n = u_{1}^n\hbox{ and } u_{N_x+1}^n = u_{N_x-1}^n,

because then
the application of the standard scheme at a boundary point :math:`i=0` or :math:`i=N_x`
will be correct and guarantee that the solution is compatible with the
boundary condition :math:`u_x=0`.

Implementation  (2)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``u`` array now needs extra elements corresponding to the ghost cells
and points. Two new point values are needed:

.. code-block:: python

        u   = zeros(Nx+3)

The arrays ``u_1`` and ``u_2`` must be defined accordingly.

Unfortunately, a major indexing problem arises with ghost cells.
The reason is that Python indices *must* start
at 0 and ``u[-1]`` will always mean the last element in ``u``.
This fact gives, apparently, a mismatch between the mathematical
indices :math:`i=-1,0,\ldots,N_x+1` and the Python indices running over
``u``: ``0,..,Nx+2``. One remedy is to change the mathematical notation
of the scheme, as in

.. math::
         u^{n+1}_i = \cdots,\quad i=1,\ldots,N_x+1,

meaning that the ghost points correspond to :math:`i=0` and :math:`i=N_x+1`.
A better solution is to use the ideas of the section :ref:`wave:indexset`:
we hide the specific index value in an index set and operate with
inner and boundary points using the index set notation.

To this end, we define ``u`` with proper length and ``Ix`` to be the corresponding
indices for the real physical points (:math:`1,2,\ldots,N_x+1`):

.. code-block:: python

        u = zeros(Nx+3)
        Ix = range(1, u.shape[0]-1)

That is, the boundary points have indices ``Ix[0]`` and ``Ix[-1]`` (as before).
We first update the solution at all physical mesh points (i.e., interior
points in the mesh extended with ghost cells):

.. code-block:: python

        for i in Ix:
            u[i] = - u_2[i] + 2*u_1[i] + \ 
                   C2*(u_1[i-1] - 2*u_1[i] + u_1[i+1])

It remains to update the ghost points. For a boundary condition :math:`u_x=0`,
the ghost value must equal to the value at the associated inner mesh
point. Computer code makes this statement precise:

.. code-block:: python

        i = Ix[0]          # x=0 boundary
        u[i-1] = u[i+1]
        i = Ix[-1]         # x=L boundary
        u[i+1] = u[i-1]

The physical solution to be plotted is now in ``u[1:-1]``, or
equivalently ``u[Ix[0]:Ix[-1]+1]``, so this slice is
the quantity to be returned from a solver function.
A complete implementation appears in the program
`wave1D_n0_ghost.py <http://tinyurl.com/jvzzcfn/wave/wave1D/wave1D_n0_ghost.py>`__.


.. warning::
    We have to be careful with how the spatial and temporal mesh
    points are stored. Say we let ``x`` be the physical mesh points,
    
    .. code-block:: python
    
            x = linspace(0, L, Nx+1)
    
    "Standard coding" of the initial condition,
    
    .. code-block:: python
    
            for i in Ix:
                u_1[i] = I(x[i])
    
    becomes wrong, since ``u_1`` and ``x`` have different lengths and the index ``i``
    corresponds to two different mesh points. In fact, ``x[i]`` corresponds
    to ``u[1+i]``. A correct implementation is
    
    .. code-block:: python
    
            for i in Ix:
                u_1[i] = I(x[i-Ix[0]])
    
    Similarly, a source term usually coded as ``f(x[i], t[n])`` is incorrect
    if ``x`` is defined to be the physical points, so ``x[i]`` must be
    replaced by ``x[i-Ix[0]]``.
    
    An alternative remedy is to let ``x`` also cover the ghost points such that
    ``u[i]`` is the value at ``x[i]``.




The ghost cell is only added to the boundary where we have a Neumann
condition. Suppose we have a Dirichlet condition at :math:`x=L` and
a homogeneous Neumann condition at :math:`x=0`. One ghost cell :math:`[-\Delta x,0]`
is added to the mesh, so the index set for the physical points
becomes :math:`\{1,\ldots,N_x+1\}`. A relevant implementation
is

.. code-block:: python

        u = zeros(Nx+2)
        Ix = range(1, u.shape[0])
        ...
        for i in Ix[:-1]:
            u[i] = - u_2[i] + 2*u_1[i] + \ 
                   C2*(u_1[i-1] - 2*u_1[i] + u_1[i+1]) + \ 
                   dt2*f(x[i-Ix[0]], t[n])
        i = Ix[-1]
        u[i] = U_0       # set Dirichlet value
        i = Ix[0]
        u[i-1] = u[i+1]  # update ghost value

The physical solution to be plotted is now in ``u[1:]``
or (as always) ``u[Ix[0]:Ix[-1]+1]``.

Generalization: variable wave velocity
======================================

Our next generalization of the 1D wave equation :ref:`(2.1) <Eq:wave:pde1>` or
:ref:`(2.12) <Eq:wave:pde2>` is to allow for a variable wave velocity :math:`c`:
:math:`c=c(x)`, usually motivated by wave motion in a domain composed of
different physical media with different properties for
propagating waves and hence different wave velocities :math:`c`.

The model PDE with a variable coefficient
-----------------------------------------

Instead of working with the squared quantity :math:`c^2(x)` we
shall for notational convenience introduce :math:`q(x) = c^2(x)`.
A 1D wave equation with variable wave velocity often takes the form

.. _Eq:wave:pde2:var:c:pde:

.. math::
   :label: wave:pde2:var:c:pde
        
        \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} =
        \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left( q(x)
        \frac{\partial u}{\partial x}\right) + f(x,t)
        
        {\thinspace .}
        

This equation sampled at a mesh point :math:`(x_i,t_n)` reads

.. math::
        
        \frac{\partial^2 }{\partial t^2} u(x_i,t_n) =
        \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left( q(x_i)
        \frac{\partial}{\partial x} u(x_i,t_n)\right) + f(x_i,t_n),
        

where the only new term is

.. math::
        
        \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left( q(x_i)
        \frac{\partial}{\partial x} u(x_i,t_n)\right) = \left[
        \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left( q(x)
        \frac{\partial u}{\partial x}\right)\right]^n_i
        {\thinspace .}
        

.. _wave:pde2:var:c:ideas:

Discretizing the variable coefficient
-------------------------------------

The principal idea is to first discretize the outer derivative.
Define

.. math::
         \phi = q(x)
        \frac{\partial u}{\partial x},
        

and use a centered derivative around :math:`x=x_i` for the derivative of :math:`\phi`:

.. math::
        
        \left[\frac{\partial\phi}{\partial x}\right]^n_i
        \approx \frac{\phi_{i+\frac{1}{2}} - \phi_{i-\frac{1}{2}}}{\Delta x}
        = [D_x\phi]^n_i
        {\thinspace .}
        

Then discretize

.. math::
        
        \phi_{i+\frac{1}{2}}  = q_{i+\frac{1}{2}}
        \left[\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}\right]^n_{i+\frac{1}{2}}
        \approx q_{i+\frac{1}{2}} \frac{u^n_{i+1} - u^n_{i}}{\Delta x}
        = [q D_x u]_{i+\frac{1}{2}}^n
        {\thinspace .}
        

Similarly,

.. math::
        
        \phi_{i-\frac{1}{2}}  = q_{i-\frac{1}{2}}
        \left[\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}\right]^n_{i-\frac{1}{2}}
        \approx q_{i-\frac{1}{2}} \frac{u^n_{i} - u^n_{i-1}}{\Delta x}
        = [q D_x u]_{i-\frac{1}{2}}^n
        {\thinspace .}
        

These intermediate results are now combined to

.. _Eq:wave:pde2:var:c:formula:

.. math::
   :label: wave:pde2:var:c:formula
        
        \left[
        \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left( q(x)
        \frac{\partial u}{\partial x}\right)\right]^n_i
        \approx \frac{1}{\Delta x^2}
        \left( q_{i+\frac{1}{2}} \left({u^n_{i+1} - u^n_{i}}\right)
        - q_{i-\frac{1}{2}} \left({u^n_{i} - u^n_{i-1}}\right)\right)
        
        {\thinspace .}
        

With operator notation we can write the discretization as

.. _Eq:wave:pde2:var:c:formula:op:

.. math::
   :label: wave:pde2:var:c:formula:op
        
        \left[

        \frac{\partial u}{\partial x}\right)\right]^n_i
        \approx [D_xq D_x u]^n_i
        
        {\thinspace .}
        


.. admonition:: Remark

   Many are tempted to use the chain rule on the
   term :math:`\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left( q(x)
   \frac{\partial u}{\partial x}\right)`, but this is not a good idea
   when discretizing such a term.




.. Needs some better explanation here - maybe the exact solution of a

.. poisson type problem (piecewise linear solution) failes if we use

.. the chain rule?

.. _wave:pde2:var:c:means:

Computing the coefficient between mesh points
---------------------------------------------

If :math:`q` is a known function of :math:`x`, we can easily evaluate
:math:`q_{i+\frac{1}{2}}` simply as :math:`q(x_{i+\frac{1}{2}})` with
:math:`x_{i+\frac{1}{2}} = x_i + \frac{1}{2}\Delta x`.
However, in many cases :math:`c`, and hence :math:`q`,
is only known as a discrete function, often at the mesh points :math:`x_i`.
Evaluating :math:`q` between two mesh points :math:`x_i` and :math:`x_{i+1}` can then
be done by averaging in three ways:

.. index:: geometric mean

.. index:: arithmetic mean

.. index:: harmonic average

.. index::
   single: averaging; geometric

.. index::
   single: averaging; arithmetic

.. index::
   single: averaging; harmonic

.. _Eq:wave:pde2:var:c:mean:arithmetic:

.. math::
   :label: wave:pde2:var:c:mean:arithmetic
        
        q_{i+\frac{1}{2}} \approx
        \frac{1}{2}\left( q_{i} + q_{i+1}\right) =
        [\overline{q}^{x}]_i,
        \quad \hbox{(arithmetic mean)}
        
        

.. _Eq:wave:pde2:var:c:mean:harmonic:

.. math::
   :label: wave:pde2:var:c:mean:harmonic
          
        q_{i+\frac{1}{2}} \approx
        2\left( \frac{1}{q_{i}} + \frac{1}{q_{i+1}}\right)^{-1},
        \quad \hbox{(harmonic mean)}
        
        

.. _Eq:wave:pde2:var:c:mean:geometric:

.. math::
   :label: wave:pde2:var:c:mean:geometric
          
        q_{i+\frac{1}{2}} \approx
        \left(q_{i}q_{i+1}\right)^{1/2},
        \quad \hbox{(geometric mean)}
        
        

The arithmetic mean in :eq:`wave:pde2:var:c:mean:arithmetic` is by
far the most commonly used averaging technique.

With the operator notation from :eq:`wave:pde2:var:c:mean:arithmetic`
we can specify the discretization of the complete variable-coefficient
wave equation in a compact way:

.. _Eq:wave:pde2:var:c:scheme:op:

.. math::
   :label: wave:pde2:var:c:scheme:op
        
        \lbrack D_tD_t u = D_x\overline{q}^{x}D_x u + f\rbrack^{n}_i
        {\thinspace .}
        
        

From this notation we immediately see what kind of differences that
each term is approximated with. The notation :math:`\overline{q}^{x}`
also specifies that the variable coefficient is approximated by
an arithmetic mean, the definition being
:math:`[\overline{q}^{x}]_{i+\frac{1}{2}}=(q_i+q_{i+1})/2`.
With the notation :math:`[D_xq D_x u]^n_i`,
we specify that :math:`q` is evaluated directly, as a function,
between the mesh points:
:math:`q(x_{i-\frac{1}{2}})` and :math:`q(x_{i+\frac{1}{2}})`.

Before any implementation, it remains to solve
:eq:`wave:pde2:var:c:scheme:op` with respect to :math:`u_i^{n+1}`:

.. math::
        
        u^{n+1}_i = - u_i^{n-1}  + 2u_i^n + \nonumber
        

.. math::
          
        \quad \left(\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}\right)^2 \left(
        \frac{1}{2}(q_{i} + q_{i+1})(u_{i+1}^n - u_{i}^n) -
        \frac{1}{2}(q_{i} + q_{i-1})(u_{i}^n - u_{i-1}^n)\right)
        + \nonumber
        

.. _Eq:wave:pde2:var:c:scheme:impl:

.. math::
   :label: wave:pde2:var:c:scheme:impl
          
         \quad \Delta t^2 f^n_i
        {\thinspace .}
        
        

.. _wave:pde2:var:c:stability:

How a variable coefficient affects the stability
------------------------------------------------

The stability criterion derived in the section :ref:`wave:pde1:stability`
reads :math:`\Delta t\leq \Delta x/c`. If :math:`c=c(x)`, the criterion will depend
on the spatial location. We must therefore choose a :math:`\Delta t` that
is small enough such that no mesh cell has :math:`\Delta x/c(x) >\Delta t`.
That is, we must use the largest :math:`c` value in the criterion:

.. math::
        
        \Delta t \leq \beta \frac{\Delta x}{\max_{x\in [0,L]}c(x)}
        {\thinspace .}
        

The parameter :math:`\beta` is included as a safety factor: in some problems with a
significantly varying :math:`c` it turns out that one must choose :math:`\beta <1` to
have stable solutions (:math:`\beta =0.9` may act as an all-round value).

.. _wave:pde2:var:c:Neumann:

Neumann condition and a variable coefficient
--------------------------------------------

Consider a Neumann condition :math:`\partial u/\partial x=0` at :math:`x=L=N_x\Delta x`,
discretized as

.. math::
         \frac{u_{i+1}^{n} - u_{i-1}^n}{2\Delta x} = 0\quad u_{i+1}^n = u_{i-1}^n,
        

for :math:`i=N_x`. Using the scheme :eq:`wave:pde2:var:c:scheme:impl`
at the end point :math:`i=N_x` with :math:`u_{i+1}^n=u_{i-1}^n` results in

.. math::
        
        u^{n+1}_i = - u_i^{n-1}  + 2u_i^n + \nonumber
        

.. math::
          
        \quad \left(\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}\right)^2 \left(
        q_{i+\frac{1}{2}}(u_{i-1}^n - u_{i}^n) -
        q_{i-\frac{1}{2}}(u_{i}^n - u_{i-1}^n)\right)
        + \nonumber
        

.. math::
          
         \quad \Delta t^2 f^n_i
        

.. math::
          
        = - u_i^{n-1}  + 2u_i^n + \left(\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}\right)^2
        (q_{i+\frac{1}{2}} + q_{i-\frac{1}{2}})(u_{i-1}^n - u_{i}^n) +
        \Delta t^2 f^n_i
        

.. _Eq:wave:pde2:var:c:scheme:impl:Neumann:

.. math::
   :label: wave:pde2:var:c:scheme:impl:Neumann
          
        \approx - u_i^{n-1}  + 2u_i^n + \left(\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}\right)^2
        2q_{i}(u_{i-1}^n - u_{i}^n) + \Delta t^2 f^n_i
        {\thinspace .}
        
        

Here we used the approximation

.. math::
        
        q_{i+\frac{1}{2}} + q_{i-\frac{1}{2}} =
        q_i + \left(\frac{dq}{dx}\right)_i \Delta x
        + \left(\frac{d^2q}{dx^2}\right)_i \Delta x^2 + \cdots
        +\nonumber
        

.. math::
          
        \quad q_i - \left(\frac{dq}{dx}\right)_i \Delta x
        + \left(\frac{d^2q}{dx^2}\right)_i \Delta x^2 + \cdots\nonumber
        

.. math::
          
        = 2q_i + 2\left(\frac{d^2q}{dx^2}\right)_i \Delta x^2 + {\cal O}(\Delta x^4)
        \nonumber
        

.. math::
          
        \approx 2q_i
        {\thinspace .}
        

An alternative derivation may apply the arithmetic mean of :math:`q` in
:eq:`wave:pde2:var:c:scheme:impl`, leading to the term

.. math::
         (q_i + \frac{1}{2}(q_{i+1}+q_{i-1}))(u_{i-1}^n-u_i^n){\thinspace .}

Since :math:`\frac{1}{2}(q_{i+1}+q_{i-1}) = q_i + {\cal O}(\Delta x^2)`,
we end up with :math:`2q_i(u_{i-1}^n-u_i^n)` for :math:`i=N_x` as we did above.

A common technique in implementations of :math:`\partial u/\partial x=0`
boundary conditions is to assume :math:`dq/dx=0` as well. This implies
:math:`q_{i+1}=q_{i-1}` and :math:`q_{i+1/2}=q_{i-1/2}` for :math:`i=N_x`.
The implications for the scheme are

.. math::
        
        u^{n+1}_i = - u_i^{n-1}  + 2u_i^n + \nonumber
        

.. math::
          
        \quad \left(\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}\right)^2 \left(
        q_{i+\frac{1}{2}}(u_{i-1}^n - u_{i}^n) -
        q_{i-\frac{1}{2}}(u_{i}^n - u_{i-1}^n)\right)
        + \nonumber
        

.. math::
          
         \quad \Delta t^2 f^n_i
        

.. _Eq:wave:pde2:var:c:scheme:impl:Neumann2:

.. math::
   :label: wave:pde2:var:c:scheme:impl:Neumann2
          
        = - u_i^{n-1}  + 2u_i^n + \left(\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}\right)^2
        2q_{i-\frac{1}{2}}(u_{i-1}^n - u_{i}^n) +
        \Delta t^2 f^n_i
        {\thinspace .}
        
        

.. _wave:pde2:var:c:impl:

Implementation of variable coefficients
---------------------------------------

The implementation of the scheme with a variable wave velocity
may assume that :math:`c` is available as an array ``c[i]`` at
the spatial mesh points. The following loop is a straightforward
implementation of the scheme :eq:`wave:pde2:var:c:scheme:impl`:

.. code-block:: python

        for i in range(1, Nx):
            u[i] = - u_2[i] + 2*u_1[i] + \ 
                   C2*(0.5*(q[i] + q[i+1])*(u_1[i+1] - u_1[i])  - \ 
                       0.5*(q[i] + q[i-1])*(u_1[i] - u_1[i-1])) + \ 
                   dt2*f(x[i], t[n])

The coefficient ``C2`` is now defined as ``(dt/dx)**2`` and *not* as the
squared Courant number since the wave velocity is variable and appears
inside the parenthesis.

With Neumann conditions :math:`u_x=0` at the
boundary, we need to combine this scheme with the discrete
version of the boundary condition, as shown in the section :ref:`wave:pde2:var:c:Neumann`.
Nevertheless, it would be convenient to reuse the formula for the
interior points and just modify the indices ``ip1=i+1`` and ``im1=i-1``
as we did in the section :ref:`wave:pde2:Neumann:impl`. Assuming
:math:`dq/dx=0` at the boundaries, we can implement the scheme at
the boundary with the following code.

.. code-block:: python

        i = 0
        ip1 = i+1
        im1 = ip1
        u[i] = - u_2[i] + 2*u_1[i] + \ 
               C2*(0.5*(q[i] + q[ip1])*(u_1[ip1] - u_1[i])  - \ 
                   0.5*(q[i] + q[im1])*(u_1[i] - u_1[im1])) + \ 
               dt2*f(x[i], t[n])

With ghost cells we can just reuse the formula for the interior
points also at the boundary, provided that the ghost values of both
:math:`u` and :math:`q` are correctly updated to ensure :math:`u_x=0` and :math:`q_x=0`.

A vectorized version of the scheme with a variable coefficient
at internal points in the mesh becomes

.. code-block:: python

        u[1:-1] = - u_2[1:-1] + 2*u_1[1:-1] + \ 
                  C2*(0.5*(q[1:-1] + q[2:])*(u_1[2:] - u_1[1:-1]) -
                      0.5*(q[1:-1] + q[:-2])*(u_1[1:-1] - u_1[:-2])) + \ 
                  dt2*f(x[1:-1], t[n])

A more general model PDE with variable coefficients
---------------------------------------------------

Sometimes a wave PDE has a variable coefficient also in front of
the time-derivative term:

.. _Eq:wave:pde2:var:c:pde2:

.. math::
   :label: wave:pde2:var:c:pde2
        
        \varrho(x)\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} =
        \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left( q(x)
        \frac{\partial u}{\partial x}\right) + f(x,t)
        
        {\thinspace .}
        

A natural scheme is

.. math::
        
        [\varrho D_tD_t u = D_x\overline{q}^xD_x u + f]^n_i
        {\thinspace .}
        

We realize that the :math:`\varrho` coefficient poses no particular
difficulty because the only value :math:`\varrho_i^n` enters the formula
above (when written out). There is hence no need for any averaging
of :math:`\varrho`. Often, :math:`\varrho` will be moved to the right-hand side,
also without any difficulty:

.. math::
        
        [D_tD_t u = \varrho^{-1}D_x\overline{q}^xD_x u + f]^n_i
        {\thinspace .}
        

Generalization: damping
-----------------------

Waves die out by two mechanisms. In 2D and 3D the energy of the wave
spreads out in space, and energy conservation then requires
the amplitude to decrease. This effect is not present in 1D.
Damping is another cause of amplitude reduction. For example,
the vibrations of a string die out because of damping due to
air resistance and non-elastic effects in the string.

The simplest way of including damping is to add a first-order derivative
to the equation (in the same way as friction forces enter a vibrating
mechanical system):

.. _Eq:wave:pde3:

.. math::
   :label: wave:pde3
        
        \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial t^2} + b\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} =
        c^2\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}
         + f(x,t),
        
        

where :math:`b \geq 0` is a prescribed damping coefficient.

A typical discretization of :eq:`wave:pde3` in terms of centered
differences reads

.. _Eq:wave:pde3:fd:

.. math::
   :label: wave:pde3:fd
        
        [D_tD_t u + bD_{2t}u = c^2D_xD_x u + f]^n_i
        {\thinspace .}
        
        

Writing out the equation and solving for the unknown :math:`u^{n+1}_i`
gives the scheme

.. _Eq:wave:pde3:fd2:

.. math::
   :label: wave:pde3:fd2
        
        u^{n+1}_i = (1 + {\frac{1}{2}}b\Delta t)^{-1}(({\frac{1}{2}}b\Delta t -1)
        u^{n-1}_i + 2u^n_i + C^2
        \left(u^{n}_{i+1}-2u^{n}_{i} + u^{n}_{i-1}\right) + \Delta t^2 f^n_i),
        
        

for :math:`i\in{{\mathcal{I^i}_x}}` and :math:`n\geq 1`.
New equations must be derived for :math:`u^1_i`, and for boundary points in case
of Neumann conditions.

The damping is very small in many wave phenomena and then only evident
for very long time simulations. This makes the standard wave equation
without damping relevant for a lot of applications.

Building a general 1D wave equation solver
==========================================

The program `wave1D_dn_vc.py <http://tinyurl.com/jvzzcfn/wave/wave1D/wave1D_dn_vc.py>`__
is a fairly general code for 1D wave propagation problems that
targets the following initial-boundary value problem

.. _Eq:wave:pde2:software:ueq:

.. math::
   :label: wave:pde2:software:ueq
        
        u_t = (c^2(x)u_x)_x + f(x,t),\quad x\in (0,L),\ t\in (0,T]
        
        

.. math::
          
        u(x,0) = I(x),\quad x\in [0,L]
        

.. math::
          
        u_t(x,0) = V(t),\quad x\in [0,L]
        

.. math::
          
        u(0,t) = U_0(t)\hbox{ or } u_x(0,t)=0,\quad t\in (0,T]
        

.. _Eq:wave:pde2:software:bcL:

.. math::
   :label: wave:pde2:software:bcL
          
        u(L,t) = U_L(t)\hbox{ or } u_x(L,t)=0,\quad t\in (0,T]
        
        

The ``solver`` function is a natural extension of the simplest
``solver`` function in the initial ``wave1D_u0.py`` program,
extended with Neumann boundary conditions (:math:`u_x=0`),
a possibly time-varying boundary condition on :math:`u` (:math:`U_0(t)`, :math:`U_L(t)`),
and a variable wave velocity. The different code segments needed
to make these extensions are shown and commented upon in the
preceding text.

The vectorization is only applied inside the time loop, not for the
initial condition or the first time steps, since this initial work
is negligible for long time simulations in 1D problems.

The following sections explain various more advanced programming
techniques applied in the general 1D wave equation solver.

User action function as a class
-------------------------------

A useful feature in the ``wave1D_dn_vc.py`` program is the specification of
the ``user_action`` function as a class. Although the ``plot_u``
function in the ``viz`` function of previous ``wave1D*.py`` programs
remembers the local variables in the ``viz`` function, it is a
cleaner solution to store the needed variables together with
the function, which is exactly what a class offers.

A class for flexible plotting, cleaning up files, and making a movie
files like function ``viz`` and ``plot_u`` did can be coded as follows:

.. code-block:: python

        class PlotSolution:
            """
            Class for the user_action function in solver.
            Visualizes the solution only.

Understanding this class requires quite some familiarity with Python
in general and class programming in particular.

.. Since all the plot frames are to be collected in a separate subdirectory,

.. we demand a (logical) "casename" from the user that is used as

.. subdirectory name in the ``make_movie_file`` method. The statements

.. in this method perform actions normally done in the operating

.. system, but the Python interface via ``shutil.rmtree``, ``os.mkdir``,

.. ``os.chdir``, etc., works on all platforms where Python works.

The constructor shows how we can flexibly import the plotting engine
as (typically) ``scitools.easyviz.gnuplot_`` or
``scitools.easyviz.matplotlib_`` (note the trailing underscore).
With the ``screen_movie`` parameter
we can suppress displaying each movie frame on the screen.
Alternatively, for slow movies associated with
fine meshes, one can set
``every_frame`` to, e.g., 10, causing every 10 frames to be shown.

The ``__call__`` method makes ``PlotSolution`` instances behave like
functions, so we can just pass an instance, say ``p``, as the
``user_action`` argument in the ``solver`` function, and any call to
``user_action`` will be a call to ``p.__call__``.

Pulse propagation in two media
------------------------------

The function ``pulse`` in ``wave1D_dn_vc.py`` demonstrates wave motion in
heterogeneous media where :math:`c` varies. One can specify an interval
where the wave velocity is decreased by a factor ``slowness_factor``
(or increased by making this factor less than one).
Four types of initial conditions are available: a rectangular pulse (``plug``),
a Gaussian function (``gaussian``), a "cosine hat" consisting of one
period of the cosine function (``cosinehat``), and half a period of
a "cosine hat" (``half-cosinehat``). These peak-shaped initial
conditions can be placed in the middle (``loc='center'``) or at
the left end (``loc='left'``) of the domain. The ``pulse``
function is a flexible tool for playing around with various wave
shapes and location of a medium with a different wave velocity:

.. code-block:: python

        def pulse(C=1, Nx=200, animate=True, version='vectorized', T=2,
                  loc='center', pulse_tp='gaussian', slowness_factor=2,
                  medium=[0.7, 0.9], every_frame=1, sigma=0.05):
            """
            Various peaked-shaped initial conditions on [0,1].
            Wave velocity is decreased by the slowness_factor inside
            medium. The loc parameter can be 'center' or 'left',
            depending on where the initial pulse is to be located.
            The sigma parameter governs the width of the pulse.
            """
            # Use scaled parameters: L=1 for domain length, c_0=1
            # for wave velocity outside the domain.
            L = 1.0
            c_0 = 1.0
            if loc == 'center':
                xc = L/2
            elif loc == 'left':
                xc = 0

            elif pulse_tp == 'plug':
                def I(x):
                    return 0 if abs(x-xc) > sigma else 1
            elif pulse_tp == 'cosinehat':
                def I(x):
                    # One period of a cosine
                    w = 2
                    a = w*sigma
                    return 0.5*(1 + cos(pi*(x-xc)/a)) \ 
                           if xc - a <= x <= xc + a else 0

            umin=-0.5; umax=1.5*I(xc)
            casename = '%s_Nx%s_sf%s' % \ 
                       (pulse_tp, Nx, slowness_factor)
            action = PlotMediumAndSolution(
                medium, casename=casename, umin=umin, umax=umax,
                every_frame=every_frame, screen_movie=animate)
        
            dt = (L/Nx)/c  # choose the stability limit with given Nx
            # Lower C will then use this dt, but smaller Nx
            solver(I=I, V=None, f=None, c=c, U_0=None, U_L=None,
                   L=L, dt=dt, C=C, T=T,
                   user_action=action, version=version,
                   stability_safety_factor=1)

The ``PlotMediumAndSolution`` class used here is a subclass of
``PlotSolution`` where the medium with reduced :math:`c` value,
as specified by the ``medium`` interval,
is visualized in the plots.


.. note::
   The argument :math:`N_x` in the ``pulse`` function does not correspond to
   the actual spatial resolution of :math:`C<1`, since the ``solver``
   function takes a fixed :math:`\Delta t` and :math:`C`, and adjusts :math:`\Delta x`
   accordingly. As seen in the ``pulse`` function,
   the specified :math:`\Delta t` is chosen according to the
   limit :math:`C=1`, so if :math:`C<1`, :math:`\Delta t` remains the same, but the
   ``solver`` function operates with a larger :math:`\Delta x` and smaller
   :math:`N_x` than was specified in the call to ``pulse``. The practical reason
   is that we always want to keep :math:`\Delta t` fixed such that
   plot frames and movies are synchronized in time regardless of the
   value of :math:`C` (i.e., :math:`\Delta x` is varies when the
   Courant number varies).




The reader is encouraged to play around with the ``pulse`` function:

.. code-block:: ipy

        >>> import wave1D_dn_vc as w
        >>> w.pulse(loc='left', pulse_tp='cosinehat', Nx=50, every_frame=10)

To easily kill the graphics by Ctrl-C and restart a new simulation it might be
easier to run the above two statements from the command line
with

.. code-block:: text

        Terminal> python -c 'import wave1D_dn_vc as w; w.pulse(...)'

Exercise 6: Find the analytical solution to a damped wave equation
------------------------------------------------------------------

Consider the wave equation with damping :eq:`wave:pde3`.
The goal is to find an exact solution to a wave problem with damping.
A starting point is the standing wave solution from
:ref:`wave:exer:standingwave`. It becomes necessary to
include a damping term :math:`e^{-ct}` and also have both a sine and cosine
component in time:

.. math::
         {u_{\small\mbox{e}}}(x,t) =  e^{-\beta t}
        \sin kx \left( A\cos\omega t
        + B\sin\omega t\right)
        {\thinspace .}
        

Find :math:`k` from the boundary conditions
:math:`u(0,t)=u(L,t)=0`. Then use the PDE to find constraints on
:math:`\beta`, :math:`\omega`, :math:`A`, and :math:`B`.
Set up a complete initial-boundary value problem
and its solution.

Problem 7: Explore symmetry boundary conditions
-----------------------------------------------

Consider the simple "plug" wave where :math:`\Omega = [-L,L]` and

.. math::
         I(x) = \left\lbrace\begin{array}{ll}
        1, & x\in [-\delta, \delta],\\ 
        0, & \hbox{otherwise}
        \end{array}\right.
        

for some number :math:`0 < \delta < L`. The other initial condition is
:math:`u_t(x,0)=0` and there is no source term :math:`f`.
The boundary conditions can be set to :math:`u=0`.
The solution to this problem is symmetric around :math:`x=0`.
This means that we can simulate the wave process in only the half
of the domain :math:`[0,L]`.

**a)**
Argue why the symmetry boundary condition
is :math:`u_x=0` at :math:`x=0`.

.. --- begin hint in exercise ---

**Hint.**
Symmetry of a function about :math:`x=x_0` means that
:math:`f(x_0+h) = f(x_0-h)`.

.. --- end hint in exercise ---

**b)**
Perform simulations of the complete wave problem from
on :math:`[-L,L]`. Thereafter, utilize the
symmetry of the solution and run a simulation
in half of the domain :math:`[0,L]`, using a boundary condition
at :math:`x=0`. Compare the two solutions and
make sure that they are the same.

**c)**
Prove the symmetry property of the solution
by setting up the complete initial-boundary value problem
and showing that if :math:`u(x,t)` is a solution, then also :math:`u(-x,t)`
is a solution.

Exercise 8: Send pulse waves through a layered medium

Use the ``pulse`` function in ``wave1D_dn_vc.py`` to investigate
sending a pulse, located with its peak at :math:`x=0`, through the
medium to the right where it hits another medium for :math:`x\in [0.7,0.9]`
where the wave velocity is decreased by a factor :math:`s_f`.

Exercise 9: Compare discretizations of a Neumann condition
----------------------------------------------------------

We have a 1D wave equation with variable wave velocity:
:math:`u_t=(qu_x)_x`.
A Neumann condition :math:`u_x` at :math:`x=0, L` can be
discretized as shown in :eq:`wave:pde2:var:c:scheme:impl:Neumann`
and :eq:`wave:pde2:var:c:scheme:impl:Neumann2`.

The aim of this exercise is to examine the rate of the numerical
error when using different ways of discretizing the Neumann condition.
As test problem, :math:`q=1+(x-L/2)^4` can be used, with :math:`f(x,t)`
adapted such that the solution has a simple form, say
:math:`u(x,t)=\cos (\pi x/L)\cos (\omega t)` for some :math:`\omega = \sqrt{q}\pi/L`.

**a)**
Perform numerical experiments and find the convergence rate of the
error using
the approximation
and :eq:`wave:pde2:var:c:scheme:impl:Neumann2`.

**b)**
Switch to :math:`q(x)=\cos(\pi x/L)`, which is symmetric at :math:`x=0,L`,
and check the convergence rate
of the scheme
:eq:`wave:pde2:var:c:scheme:impl:Neumann2`. Now,
:math:`q_{i-1/2}` is a 2nd-order approximation to :math:`q_i`,
:math:`q_{i-1/2}=q_i + 0.25q_i''\Delta x^2 + \cdots`, because :math:`q_i'=0`
for :math:`i=N_x` (a similar argument can be applied to the case :math:`i=0`).

**c)**
A third discretization can be based on a simple and convenient,
but less accurate, one-sided difference:
:math:`u_{i}-u_{i-1}=0` at :math:`i=N_x` and :math:`u_{i+1}-u_i=0` at :math:`i=0`.
Derive the resulting scheme in detail and implement it.
Run experiments to establish the rate of convergence.

**d)**
A fourth technique is to view the scheme as

.. math::
         [D_tD_tu]^n_i = \frac{1}{\Delta x}\left(
        [qD_xu]_{i+\frac{1}{2}}^n - [qD_xu]_{i-\frac{1}{2}}^n\right)
        + [f]_i^n,

and place the boundary at :math:`x_{i+\frac{1}{2}}`, :math:`i=N_x`, instead of
exactly at the physical boundary. With this idea,
we can just set :math:`[qD_xu]_{i+\frac{1}{2}}^n=0`. Derive the complete scheme
using this technique. The implementation of the boundary condition at
:math:`L-\Delta x/2` is :math:`{\mathcal{O}(\Delta x^2)}` accurate, but the interesting question
is what impact the movement of the boundary has on the convergence
rate (compute the errors as usual over the entire mesh).

.. _wave:fd2:exer:verify:cubic:

Exercise 10: Verification by a cubic polynomial in space
--------------------------------------------------------

The purpose of this exercise is to verify the implementation of the
``solver`` function in the program `wave1D_n0.py <http://tinyurl.com/jvzzcfn/wave/wave1D/wave1D_n0.py>`__ by using an exact numerical solution
for the wave equation :math:`u_{tt}=c^2u_{xx} + f` with Neumann boundary
conditions :math:`u_x(0,t)=u_x(L,t)=0`.

A similar verification is used in the file `wave1D_u0.py <http://tinyurl.com/jvzzcfn/wave/wave1D/wave1D_u0.py>`__, which solves the same PDE, but with
Dirichlet boundary conditions :math:`u(0,t)=u(L,t)=0`.  The idea of the
verification test in function ``test_quadratic`` in ``wave1D_u0.py`` is to
a solution that is a lower-order polynomial such that both the PDE
problem, the boundary conditions, and all the discrete equations are
exactly fulfilled. Then the ``solver`` function should reproduce this
exact solution to machine precision.  More precisely, we seek
:math:`u=X(x)T(t)`, with :math:`T(t)` as a linear function and :math:`X(x)` as a
parabola that fulfills the boundary conditions.  Inserting this :math:`u` in
the PDE determines :math:`f`.  It tuns out that :math:`u` also fulfills the
discrete equations, because the truncation error of the discretized
PDE has derivatives in :math:`x` and :math:`t` of order four and higher. These
derivatives all vanish for a quadratic :math:`X(x)` and linear :math:`T(t)`.

It would be attractive to use a similar approach in the case of
Neumann conditions. We set :math:`u=X(x)T(t)` and seek lower-order
polynomials :math:`X` and :math:`T`.
To force :math:`u_x` to vanish at the boundary, we let :math:`X_x` be
a parabola. Then :math:`X` is a cubic polynomial. The fourth-order
derivative of a cubic polynomial vanishes, so :math:`u=X(x)T(t)`
will fulfill the discretized PDE also in this case, if :math:`f`
is adjusted such that :math:`u` fulfills the PDE.

However, the discrete boundary condition is not exactly fulfilled
by this choice of :math:`u`. The reason is that

.. _Eq:wave:fd2:exer:verify:cubic:D2x:

.. math::
   :label: wave:fd2:exer:verify:cubic:D2x
        
        [D_{2x}u]^n_i = u_{x}(x_i,t_n) + \frac{1}{6}u_{xxx}(x_i,t_n)\Delta x^2
        + {\mathcal{O}(\Delta x^4)}{\thinspace .}
        
        

At the boundary two boundary points, :math:`X_x(x)=0` such that :math:`u_x=0`.
However, :math:`u_{xxx}` is a constant and not zero
when :math:`X(x)` is a cubic polynomial.
Therefore, our :math:`u=X(x)T(t)` fulfills

.. math::
         [D_{2x}u]^n_i = \frac{1}{6}u_{xxx}(x_i,t_n)\Delta x^2,
        

and not

.. math::
         [D_{2x}u]^n_i =0,quad i=0,N_x,

as it should. (Note that all the higher-order terms :math:`{\mathcal{O}(\Delta x^4)}`
also have higher-order derivatives that vanish for a cubic polynomial.)
So to summarize, the fundamental problem is that :math:`u` as a product of
a cubic polynomial and a linear or quadratic polynomial in time
is not an exact solution of the discrete boundary conditions.

To make progress,
we assume that :math:`u=X(x)T(t)`, where :math:`T` for simplicity is taken as a
prescribed linear function :math:`1+\frac{1}{2}t`, and :math:`X(x)` is taken
as an *unknown* cubic polynomial :math:`\sum_{j=0}^3 a_jx^j`.
There are two different ways of determining the coefficients
:math:`a_0,\ldots,a_3` such that both the discretized PDE and the
discretized boundary conditions are fulfilled, under the
constraint that we can specify a function :math:`f(x,t)` for the PDE to feed
to the ``solver`` function in ``wave1D_n0.py``. Both approaches
are explained in the subexercises.

.. {wave:fd2:exer:verify:cubic:D2x}

**a)**
One can insert :math:`u` in the discretized PDE and find the corresponding :math:`f`.
Then one can insert :math:`u` in the discretized boundary conditions.
This yields two equations for the four coefficients :math:`a_0,\ldots,a_3`.
To find the coefficients, one can set :math:`a_0=0` and :math:`a_1=1` for
simplicity and then determine :math:`a_2` and :math:`a_3`. This approach will make
:math:`a_2` and :math:`a_3` depend on :math:`\Delta x` and :math:`f` will depend on both
:math:`\Delta x` and :math:`\Delta t`.

Use ``sympy`` to perform analytical computations.
A starting point is to define :math:`u` as follows:

.. code-block:: python

        def test_cubic1():
            import sympy as sm
            x, t, c, L, dx, dt = sm.symbols('x t c L dx dt')
            i, n = sm.symbols('i n', integer=True)
        
            # Assume discrete solution is a polynomial of degree 3 in x
            T = lambda t: 1 + sm.Rational(1,2)*t  # Temporal term
            a = sm.symbols('a_0 a_1 a_2 a_3')
            X = lambda x: sum(a[q]*x**q for q in range(4))  # Spatial term
            u = lambda x, t: X(x)*T(t)

The symbolic expression for :math:`u` is reached by calling ``u(x,t)``
with ``x`` and ``t`` as ``sympy`` symbols.

Define ``DxDx(u, i, n)``, ``DtDt(u, i, n)``, and ``D2x(u, i, n)``
as Python functions for returning the difference
approximations :math:`[D_xD_x u]^n_i`, :math:`[D_tD_t u]^n_i`, and
:math:`[D_{2x}u]^n_i`. The next step is to set up the residuals
for the equations :math:`[D_{2x}u]^n_0=0` and :math:`[D_{2x}u]^n_{N_x}=0`,
where :math:`N_x=L/\Delta x`. Call the residuals ``R_0`` and ``R_L``.
Substitute :math:`a_0` and :math:`a_1` by 0 and 1, respectively, in
``R_0``, ``R_L``, and ``a``:

.. code-block:: python

        R_0 = R_0.subs(a[0], 0).subs(a[1], 1)
        R_L = R_L.subs(a[0], 0).subs(a[1], 1)
        a = list(a)  # enable in-place assignment
        a[0:2] = 0, 1

Determining :math:`a_2` and :math:`a_3` from the discretized boundary conditions
is then about solving two equations with respect to :math:`a_2` and :math:`a_3`,
i.e., ``a[2:]``:

.. code-block:: python

        s = sm.solve([R_0, R_L], a[2:])
        # s is dictionary with the unknowns a[2] and a[3] as keys
        a[2:] = s[a[2]], s[a[3]]

Now, ``a`` contains computed values and ``u`` will automatically use
these new values since ``X`` accesses ``a``.

Compute the source term :math:`f` from the discretized PDE:
:math:`f^n_i = [D_tD_t u - c^2D_xD_x u]^n_i`. Turn :math:`u`, the time
derivative :math:`u_t` (needed for the initial condition :math:`V(x)`),
and :math:`f` into Python functions. Set numerical values for
:math:`L`, :math:`N_x`, :math:`C`, and :math:`c`. Prescribe the time interval as
:math:`\Delta t = CL/(N_xc)`, which imply :math:`\Delta x = c\Delta t/C = L/N_x`.
Define new functions ``I(x)``, ``V(x)``, and ``f(x,t)`` as wrappers of the ones
made above, where fixed values of :math:`L`, :math:`c`, :math:`\Delta x`, and :math:`\Delta t`
are inserted, such that ``I``, ``V``, and ``f`` can be passed on to the
``solver`` function. Finally, call ``solver`` with a ``user_action``
function that compares the numerical solution to this exact
solution :math:`u` of the discrete PDE problem.

.. --- begin hint in exercise ---

**Hint.**
To turn a ``sympy`` expression ``e``, depending on a series of
symbols, say ``x``, ``t``, ``dx``, ``dt``, ``L``, and ``c``, into plain
Python function ``e_exact(x,t,L,dx,dt,c)``, one can write

.. code-block:: python

        e_exact = sm.lambdify([x,t,L,dx,dt,c], e, 'numpy')

The ``'numpy'`` argument is a good habit as the ``e_exact`` function
will then work with array arguments if it contains mathematical
functions (but here we only do plain arithmetics, which automatically
work with arrays).

.. --- end hint in exercise ---

**b)**
An alternative way of determining :math:`a_0,\ldots,a_3` is to reason as
follows. We first construct :math:`X(x)` such that the boundary conditions
are fulfilled: :math:`X=x(L-x)`. However, to compensate for the fact
that this choice of :math:`X` does not fulfill the discrete boundary
condition, we seek :math:`u` such that

.. math::
         u_x = \frac{\partial}{\partial x}x(L-x)T(t) - \frac{1}{6}u_{xxx}\Delta x^2,

since this :math:`u` will fit the discrete boundary condition.
Assuming :math:`u=T(t)\sum_{j=0}^3a_jx^j`, we can use the above equation to
determine the coefficients :math:`a_1,a_2,a_3`. A value, e.g., 1 can be used for
:math:`a_0`. The following ``sumpy`` code computes this :math:`u`:

.. code-block:: python

        def test_cubic2():
            import sympy as sm
            x, t, c, L, dx = sm.symbols('x t c L dx')
            T = lambda t: 1 + sm.Rational(1,2)*t  # Temporal term
            # Set u as a 3rd-degree polynomial in space
            X = lambda x: sum(a[i]*x**i for i in range(4))
            a = sm.symbols('a_0 a_1 a_2 a_3')
            u = lambda x, t: X(x)*T(t)
            # Force discrete boundary condition to be zero by adding
            # a correction term the analytical suggestion x*(L-x)*T
            # u_x = x*(L-x)*T(t) - 1/6*u_xxx*dx**2
            R = sm.diff(u(x,t), x) - (
                x*(L-x) - sm.Rational(1,6)*sm.diff(u(x,t), x, x, x)*dx**2)
            # R is a polynomial: force all coefficients to vanish.
            # Turn R to Poly to extract coefficients:
            R = sm.poly(R, x)
            coeff = R.all_coeffs()
            s = sm.solve(coeff, a[1:])  # a[0] is not present in R
            # s is dictionary with a[i] as keys
            # Fix a[0] as 1
            s[a[0]] = 1
            X = lambda x: sm.simplify(sum(s[a[i]]*x**i for i in range(4)))
            u = lambda x, t: X(x)*T(t)
            print 'u:', u(x,t)

The next step is to find the source term ``f_e`` by inserting ``u_e``
in the PDE. Thereafter, turn ``u``, ``f``, and the time derivative of ``u``
into plain Python functions as in a), and then wrap these functions
in new functions ``I``, ``V``, and ``f``, with the right signature as
required by the ``solver`` function. Set parameters as in a) and
check that the solution is exact to machine precision at each
time level using an appropriate ``user_action`` function.
