Implementation          (3)
===========================

.. index::
   single: wave equation; 2D, implementation

We shall now describe in detail various Python implementations
for solving a standard 2D, linear wave equation with constant
wave velocity and :math:`u=0` on the
boundary. The wave equation is to be solved
in the space-time domain :math:`\Omega\times (0,T]`,
where :math:`\Omega = (0,L_x)\times (0,L_y)` is a rectangular spatial
domain. More precisely,
the complete initial-boundary value problem is defined by

.. _Eq:_auto41:

.. math::

    \tag{113}
    u_{tt} = c^2(u_{xx} + u_{yy}) + f(x,y,t),\quad (x,y)\in \Omega,\ t\in (0,T],
        
        

.. _Eq:_auto42:

.. math::

    \tag{114}
    u(x,y,0) = I(x,y),\quad (x,y)\in\Omega,
        
        

.. _Eq:_auto43:

.. math::

    \tag{115}
    u_t(x,y,0) = V(x,y),\quad (x,y)\in\Omega,
        
        

.. _Eq:_auto44:

.. math::

    \tag{116}
    u = 0,\quad (x,y)\in\partial\Omega,\ t\in (0,T],
        
        

where :math:`\partial\Omega` is the boundary of :math:`\Omega`, in this case
the four sides of the rectangle :math:`\Omega = [0,L_x]\times [0,L_y]`:
:math:`x=0`, :math:`x=L_x`, :math:`y=0`, and :math:`y=L_y`.

The PDE is discretized as

.. math::
         [D_t D_t u = c^2(D_xD_x u + D_yD_y u) + f]^n_{i,j},
        

which leads to an explicit updating formula to be implemented in a
program:

.. math::
        
        u^{n+1} = -u^{n-1}_{i,j} + 2u^n_{i,j} + \nonumber
        

.. _Eq:wave:2D3D:impl1:2Du0:ueq:discrete:

.. math::

    \tag{117}
    \quad C_x^2(
        u^{n}_{i+1,j} - 2u^{n}_{i,j} + u^{n}_{i-1,j}) + C_y^2
        (u^{n}_{i,j+1} - 2u^{n}_{i,j} + u^{n}_{i,j-1}) + \Delta t^2 f_{i,j}^n,
        
        

for all interior mesh points :math:`i\in{{\mathcal{I^i}_x}}` and
:math:`j\in{{\mathcal{I^i}_y}}`, and for :math:`n\in{{\mathcal{I^+}_t}}`.
The constants :math:`C_x` and :math:`C_y` are defined as

.. math::
         C_x = c\frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x},\quad C_x = c\frac{\Delta t}{\Delta y}
        {\thinspace .}
        

At the boundary, we simply set :math:`u^{n+1}_{i,j}=0` for
:math:`i=0`, :math:`j=0,\ldots,N_y`; :math:`i=N_x`, :math:`j=0,\ldots,N_y`;
:math:`j=0`, :math:`i=0,\ldots,N_x`; and :math:`j=N_y`, :math:`i=0,\ldots,N_x`.
For the first step, :math:`n=0`, :ref:`(117) <Eq:wave:2D3D:impl1:2Du0:ueq:discrete>`
is combined with the discretization of the initial condition :math:`u_t=V`,
:math:`[D_{2t} u = V]^0_{i,j}` to obtain a special formula for
:math:`u^1_{i,j}` at the interior mesh points:

.. math::
        
        u^{1} = u^0_{i,j} + \Delta t V_{i,j} + \nonumber
        

.. _Eq:wave:2D3D:impl1:2Du0:ueq:n0:discrete:

.. math::

    \tag{118}
    \quad {\frac{1}{2}}C_x^2(
        u^{0}_{i+1,j} - 2u^{0}_{i,j} + u^{0}_{i-1,j}) + {\frac{1}{2}}C_y^2
        (u^{0}_{i,j+1} - 2u^{0}_{i,j} + u^{0}_{i,j-1}) + \frac{1}{2}\Delta t^2f_{i,j}^n,
        
        

The algorithm is very similar to the one in 1D:

1. Set initial condition :math:`u^0_{i,j}=I(x_i,y_j)`

2. Compute :math:`u^1_{i,j}` from :ref:`(117) <Eq:wave:2D3D:impl1:2Du0:ueq:discrete>`

3. Set :math:`u^1_{i,j}=0` for the boundaries :math:`i=0,N_x`, :math:`j=0,N_y`

4. For :math:`n=1,2,\ldots,N_t`:

 a. Find :math:`u^{n+1}_{i,j}` from :ref:`(117) <Eq:wave:2D3D:impl1:2Du0:ueq:discrete>`
    for all internal mesh points, :math:`i\in{{\mathcal{I^i}_x}}`, :math:`j\in{{\mathcal{I^i}_y}}`

 b. Set :math:`u^{n+1}_{i,j}=0` for the boundaries :math:`i=0,N_x`, :math:`j=0,N_y`

.. _wave2D3D:impl:scalar:

Scalar computations
-------------------

The ``solver`` function for a 2D case with constant wave velocity and
boundary condition :math:`u=0` is analogous to the 1D case with similar parameter
values (see ``wave1D_u0.py``), apart from a few necessary
extensions. The code is found in the program
`wave2D_u0.py <http://tinyurl.com/nm5587k/wave/wave2D_u0/wave2D_u0.py>`__.

Domain and mesh
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The spatial domain is now :math:`[0,L_x]\times [0,L_y]`, specified
by the arguments ``Lx`` and ``Ly``. Similarly, the number of mesh
points in the :math:`x` and :math:`y` directions,
:math:`N_x` and :math:`N_y`, become the arguments ``Nx`` and ``Ny``.
In multi-dimensional problems it makes less sense to specify a
Courant number since the wave velocity is a vector and mesh spacings
may differ in the various spatial directions.
We therefore give :math:`\Delta t` explicitly. The signature of
the ``solver`` function is then

.. code-block:: python

        def solver(I, V, f, c, Lx, Ly, Nx, Ny, dt, T,
                   user_action=None, version='scalar'):

Key parameters used in the calculations are created as

.. code-block:: python

        x = linspace(0, Lx, Nx+1)                  # mesh points in x dir
        y = linspace(0, Ly, Ny+1)                  # mesh points in y dir
        dx = x[1] - x[0]
        dy = y[1] - y[0]
        Nt = int(round(T/float(dt)))
        t = linspace(0, N*dt, N+1)                 # mesh points in time
        Cx2 = (c*dt/dx)**2;  Cy2 = (c*dt/dy)**2    # help variables
        dt2 = dt**2

Solution arrays
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We store :math:`u^{n+1}_{i,j}`, :math:`u^{n}_{i,j}`, and
:math:`u^{n-1}_{i,j}` in three two-dimensional arrays,

.. code-block:: python

        u   = zeros((Nx+1,Ny+1))   # solution array
        u_1 = zeros((Nx+1,Ny+1))   # solution at t-dt
        u_2 = zeros((Nx+1,Ny+1))   # solution at t-2*dt

where :math:`u^{n+1}_{i,j}` corresponds to ``u[i,j]``,
:math:`u^{n}_{i,j}` to ``u_1[i,j]``, and
:math:`u^{n-1}_{i,j}` to ``u_2[i,j]``

.. index:: index set notation

Index sets
~~~~~~~~~~

It is also convenient to introduce the index sets (cf. The section :ref:`wave:indexset`)

.. code-block:: python

        Ix = range(0, u.shape[0])
        Iy = range(0, u.shape[1])
        It = range(0, t.shape[0])

Computing the solution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Inserting the initial
condition ``I`` in ``u_1`` and making a callback to the user in terms of
the ``user_action`` function is a straightforward generalization of
the 1D code from the section :ref:`wave:string:impl`:

.. code-block:: python

        for i in Ix:
            for j in Iy:
                u_1[i,j] = I(x[i], y[j])
        
        if user_action is not None:
            user_action(u_1, x, xv, y, yv, t, 0)

The ``user_action`` function has additional arguments compared to the
1D case. The arguments ``xv`` and ``yv`` will be commented
upon in the section :ref:`wave2D3D:impl:vectorized`.

The key finite difference formula :ref:`(110) <Eq:wave:2D3D:models:unp1>`
for updating the solution at
a time level is implemented in a separate function as

.. code-block:: python

        def advance_scalar(u, u_1, u_2, f, x, y, t, n, Cx2, Cy2, dt2,
                           V=None, step1=False):
            Ix = range(0, u.shape[0]);  Iy = range(0, u.shape[1])
            if step1:
                dt = sqrt(dt2)  # save
                Cx2 = 0.5*Cx2;  Cy2 = 0.5*Cy2; dt2 = 0.5*dt2  # redefine
                D1 = 1;  D2 = 0
            else:
                D1 = 2;  D2 = 1
            for i in Ix[1:-1]:
                for j in Iy[1:-1]:
                    u_xx = u_1[i-1,j] - 2*u_1[i,j] + u_1[i+1,j]
                    u_yy = u_1[i,j-1] - 2*u_1[i,j] + u_1[i,j+1]
                    u[i,j] = D1*u_1[i,j] - D2*u_2[i,j] + \ 
                             Cx2*u_xx + Cy2*u_yy + dt2*f(x[i], y[j], t[n])
                    if step1:
                        u[i,j] += dt*V(x[i], y[j])
            # Boundary condition u=0
            j = Iy[0]
            for i in Ix: u[i,j] = 0
            j = Iy[-1]
            for i in Ix: u[i,j] = 0
            i = Ix[0]
            for j in Iy: u[i,j] = 0
            i = Ix[-1]
            for j in Iy: u[i,j] = 0
            return u

The ``step1`` variable has been introduced to allow the formula to be
reused for first step :math:`u^1_{i,j}`:

.. code-block:: python

        u = advance_scalar(u, u_1, u_2, f, x, y, t,
                           n, Cx2, Cy2, dt, V, step1=True)

Below, we will make many alternative implementations of the
``advance_scalar`` function to speed up the code since most of
the CPU time in simulations is spent in this function.

Finally, we remark that the ``solver`` function in the ``wave2D_u0.py`` code
updates arrays for the next time step by switching references as
described in the section :ref:`wave:pde1:impl:ref:switch`. If the solution
``u`` is returned from ``solver``, which it is not, it is important to
set ``u = u_1`` after the time loop, otherwise ``u`` actually contains ``u_2``.

.. _wave2D3D:impl:vectorized:

Vectorized computations
-----------------------

The scalar code above turns out to be extremely slow for large 2D
meshes, and probably useless in 3D beyond debugging of small test cases.
Vectorization is therefore a must for multi-dimensional
finite difference computations in Python. For example,
with a mesh consisting of :math:`30\times 30` cells, vectorization
brings down the CPU time by a factor of 70 (!).

In the vectorized case, we must be able to evaluate user-given functions
like :math:`I(x,y)` and :math:`f(x,y,t)` for the entire mesh in one operation (without
loops). These user-given functions are
provided as Python functions ``I(x,y)``
and ``f(x,y,t)``, respectively.
Having the one-dimensional coordinate arrays ``x`` and ``y`` is not
sufficient when calling ``I`` and ``f`` in a vectorized way.
We must extend ``x`` and ``y`` to their vectorized versions ``xv`` and ``yv``:

.. code-block:: python

        from numpy import newaxis
        xv = x[:,newaxis]
        yv = y[newaxis,:]
        # or
        xv = x.reshape((x.size, 1))
        yv = y.reshape((1, y.size))

This is a standard required technique when evaluating functions over
a 2D mesh, say ``sin(xv)*cos(xv)``, which then gives a result with shape
``(Nx+1,Ny+1)``. Calling ``I(xv, yv)`` and ``f(xv, yv, t[n])`` will now
return ``I`` and ``f`` values for the entire set of mesh points.

With the ``xv`` and ``yv`` arrays for vectorized computing,
setting the initial condition is just a matter of

.. code-block:: python

        u_1[:,:] = I(xv, yv)

One could also have written ``u_1 = I(xv, yv)`` and let ``u_1`` point
to a new object, but vectorized operations often make use of
direct insertion in the original array through ``u_1[:,:]``, because
sometimes not all of the array is to be filled by such a function
evaluation. This is the case with the computational scheme for :math:`u^{n+1}_{i,j}`:

.. code-block:: python

        def advance_vectorized(u, u_1, u_2, f_a, Cx2, Cy2, dt2,
                               V=None, step1=False):
            if step1:
                dt = sqrt(dt2)  # save
                Cx2 = 0.5*Cx2;  Cy2 = 0.5*Cy2; dt2 = 0.5*dt2  # redefine
                D1 = 1;  D2 = 0
            else:
                D1 = 2;  D2 = 1
            u_xx = u_1[:-2,1:-1] - 2*u_1[1:-1,1:-1] + u_1[2:,1:-1]
            u_yy = u_1[1:-1,:-2] - 2*u_1[1:-1,1:-1] + u_1[1:-1,2:]
            u[1:-1,1:-1] = D1*u_1[1:-1,1:-1] - D2*u_2[1:-1,1:-1] + \ 
                           Cx2*u_xx + Cy2*u_yy + dt2*f_a[1:-1,1:-1]
            if step1:
                u[1:-1,1:-1] += dt*V[1:-1, 1:-1]
            # Boundary condition u=0
            j = 0
            u[:,j] = 0
            j = u.shape[1]-1
            u[:,j] = 0
            i = 0
            u[i,:] = 0
            i = u.shape[0]-1

Array slices in 2D are more complicated to understand than those in
1D, but the logic from 1D applies to each dimension separately.
For example, when doing :math:`u^{n}_{i,j} - u^{n}_{i-1,j}` for :math:`i\in{{\mathcal{I^+}_x}}`,
we just keep ``j`` constant and make a slice in the first index:
``u_1[1:,j] - u_1[:-1,j]``, exactly as in 1D. The ``1:`` slice
specifies all the indices :math:`i=1,2,\ldots,N_x` (up to the last
valid index),
while ``:-1`` specifies the relevant indices for the second term:
:math:`0,1,\ldots,N_x-1` (up to, but not including the last index).

In the above code segment, the situation is slightly more complicated,
because each displaced slice in one direction is
accompanied by a ``1:-1`` slice in the other direction. The reason is
that we only work with the internal points for the index that is
kept constant in a difference.

The boundary conditions along the four sides makes use of
a slice consisting of all indices along a boundary:

.. code-block:: python

        u[: ,0] = 0
        u[:,Ny] = 0
        u[0 ,:] = 0
        u[Nx,:] = 0

In the vectorized update of ``u`` (above), the function ``f`` is first computed
as an array over all mesh points:

.. code-block:: text

        f_a = f(xv, yv, t[n])

We could, alternatively, have used the call ``f(xv, yv, t[n])[1:-1,1:-1]``
in the last term of the update statement, but other implementations
in compiled languages benefit from having ``f`` available in an array
rather than calling our Python function ``f(x,y,t)`` for
every point.

Also in the ``advance_vectorized`` function we have introduced a
boolean ``step1`` to reuse the formula for the first time step
in the same way as we did with ``advance_scalar``.
We refer to the ``solver`` function in ``wave2D_u0.py``
for the details on how the overall algorithm is implemented.

The callback function now has the arguments
``u, x, xv, y, yv, t, n``. The inclusion of ``xv`` and ``yv`` makes it
easy to, e.g., compute an exact 2D solution in the callback function
and compute errors, through an expression like
``u - u_exact(xv, yv, t[n])``.

Verification          (3)
-------------------------

Testing a quadratic solution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The 1D solution from the section :ref:`wave:pde2:fd:verify:quadratic` can be
generalized to multi-dimensions and provides a test case where the
exact solution also fulfills the discrete equations, such that we know
(to machine precision) what numbers the solver function should
produce. In 2D we use the following generalization of
:ref:`(30) <Eq:wave:pde2:fd:verify:quadratic:uex>`:

.. _Eq:wave2D3D:impl:verify:quadratic:

.. math::

    \tag{119}
    {u_{\small\mbox{e}}}(x,y,t) = x(L_x-x)y(L_y-y)(1+{\frac{1}{2}}t)
        {\thinspace .}
        
        

This solution fulfills the PDE problem if :math:`I(x,y)={u_{\small\mbox{e}}}(x,y,0)`,
:math:`V=\frac{1}{2}{u_{\small\mbox{e}}}(x,y,0)`, and :math:`f=2c^2(1+{\frac{1}{2}}t)(y(L_y-y) +
x(L_x-x))`. To show that :math:`{u_{\small\mbox{e}}}` also solves the discrete equations,
we start with the general results :math:`[D_t D_t 1]^n=0`, :math:`[D_t D_t t]^n=0`,
and :math:`[D_t D_t t^2]=2`, and use these to compute

.. math::
        
        [D_xD_x {u_{\small\mbox{e}}}]^n_{i,j} &= [y(L_y-y)(1+{\frac{1}{2}}t) D_xD_x x(L_x-x)]^n_{i,j}\\ 
        &= y_j(L_y-y_j)(1+{\frac{1}{2}}t_n)(-2){\thinspace .}
        

A similar calculation must be carried out for the :math:`[D_yD_y
{u_{\small\mbox{e}}}]^n_{i,j}` and :math:`[D_tD_t {u_{\small\mbox{e}}}]^n_{i,j}` terms.  One must also show
that the quadratic solution fits the special formula for
:math:`u^1_{i,j}`. The details are left as :ref:`wave:exer:quadratic:2D`.
The ``test_quadratic`` function in the
`wave2D_u0.py <http://tinyurl.com/nm5587k/wave/wave2D_u0/wave2D_u0.py>`__
program implements this verification as a nose test.

Exercise 15: Check that a solution fulfills the discrete model
--------------------------------------------------------------

Carry out all mathematical details to show that
:ref:`(119) <Eq:wave2D3D:impl:verify:quadratic>` is indeed a solution of the
discrete model for a 2D wave equation with :math:`u=0` on the boundary.
One must check the boundary conditions, the initial conditions,
the general discrete equation at a time level and the special
version of this equation for the first time level.

Project 16: Calculus with 2D mesh functions
-------------------------------------------

The goal of this project is to redo
:ref:`wave:exer:mesh1D:calculus` with 2D
mesh functions (:math:`f_{i,j}`).

**Differentiation.**
The differentiation results in a discrete gradient
function, which in the 2D case can be represented by a three-dimensional
array ``df[d,i,j]`` where ``d`` represents the direction of
the derivative, and ``i,j`` is a mesh point in 2D.
Use centered differences for
the derivative at inner points and one-sided forward or backward
differences at the boundary points. Construct unit tests and
write a corresponding test function.

**Integration.**
The integral of a 2D mesh function :math:`f_{i,j}` is defined as

.. math::
         F_{i,j} = \int_{y_0}^{y_j} \int_{x_0}^{x_i} f(x,y)dxdy,

where :math:`f(x,y)` is a function that takes on the values of the
discrete mesh function :math:`f_{i,j}` at the mesh points, but can also
be evaluated in between the mesh points. The particular variation
between mesh points can be taken as bilinear, but this is not
important as we will use a product Trapezoidal rule to approximate
the integral over a cell in the mesh and then we only need to
evaluate :math:`f(x,y)` at the mesh points.

Suppose :math:`F_{i,j}` is computed. The calculation of :math:`F_{i+1,j}`
is then

.. math::
        
        F_{i+1,j} &= F_{i,j} + \int_{x_i}^{x_{i+1}}\int_{y_0}^{y_j} f(x,y)dydx\\ 
        & \approx \Delta x \frac{1}{2}\left(
        \int_{y_0}^{y_j} f(x_{i},y)dy
        + \int_{y_0}^{y_j} f(x_{i+1},y)dy\right)
        

The integrals in the :math:`y` direction can be approximated by a Trapezoidal
rule. A similar idea can be used to compute :math:`F_{i,j+1}`. Thereafter,
:math:`F_{i+1,j+1}` can be computed by adding the integral over the final
corner cell to :math:`F_{i+1,j} + F_{i,j+1} - F_{i,j}`. Carry out the
details of these computations and implement a function that can
return :math:`F_{i,j}` for all mesh indices :math:`i` and :math:`j`. Use the
fact that the Trapezoidal rule is exact for linear functions and
write a test function.

Exercise 17: Implement Neumann conditions in 2D
-----------------------------------------------

Modify the `wave2D_u0.py <http://tinyurl.com/nm5587k/wave/wave2D_u0/wave2D_u0.py>`__
program, which solves the 2D wave equation :math:`u_{tt}=c^2(u_{xx}+u_{yy})`
with constant wave velocity :math:`c` and :math:`u=0` on the boundary, to have
Neumann boundary conditions: :math:`\partial u/\partial n=0`.
Include both scalar code (for debugging and reference) and
vectorized code (for speed).

To test the code, use :math:`u=1.2` as solution (:math:`I(x,y)=1.2`, :math:`V=f=0`, and
:math:`c` arbitrary), which should be exactly reproduced with any mesh
as long as the stability criterion is satisfied.
Another test is to use the plug-shaped pulse
in the ``pulse`` function from the section :ref:`wave:pde2:software`
and the `wave1D_dn_vc.py <http://tinyurl.com/nm5587k/wave/wave1D/wave1D_dn_vc.py>`__
program. This pulse
is exactly propagated in 1D if :math:`c\Delta t/\Delta x=1`. Check
that also the 2D program can propagate this pulse exactly
in :math:`x` direction (:math:`c\Delta t/\Delta x=1`, :math:`\Delta y` arbitrary)
and :math:`y` direction (:math:`c\Delta t/\Delta y=1`, :math:`\Delta x` arbitrary).

pure scalar Python code, vectorized code, Cython-compiled loops,
