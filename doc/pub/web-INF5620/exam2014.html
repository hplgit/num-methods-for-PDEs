<b>NOTE:</b>
This is a first version of the text for the exam and not
yet approved by the sensor. There may be small adjustments in the
wording. The final version will be published by Dec 1 and marked
<b>final version</b>.

<p>
There is also a <a href="exam2014.pdf" target="_self">PDF version</a> of this document.

<p>
<b>About the exam.</b>
Six problems are given for this exam. For each
problem, the candidate must prepare a 20 min oral presentation in
Norwegian or English. Try to communicate a good overview and
understanding of the topic, but compose the talk so that you can
demonstrate knowledge about details too. Some of the problems require
graphical illustrations - you can either sketch graphics on the
whiteboard or bring your laptop or tablet to show or compute the
graphics. You can send movies to <a href="mailto:hpl@simula.no" target="_self">hpl@simula.no</a> and get them played on the exam (having them
on GitHub is perhaps easiest).  Otherwise
there are <em>no aids</em> besides a whiteboard. You will have access to a
printout of the present document in the exam room. (Experience with this type
of exam and various aids tells that learning the content by heart
gives by far the best delivery and communication of understanding.)

<p>
You will throw a die 10 minutes before your exam starts, and the
number of eyes determines the problem to be presented. You can then
use all the material you have brought with you to make the final
preparations for the talk.  After the talk, you will be given some
questions, either about parts of your presention or facts from the
other problems.

<p>
<b>Note:</b> We write <em>a lot</em> during the presentations. The writing
is no indication of whether you say good or bad things.

<p>
<div class="alert alert-block alert-warning alert-text-normal">
<b>Show up 0845 in the morning!</b>
<p>
Usually some candidates decide not to show up on the exam so
everybody must meet 0845 in the morning on the day they want to take
the exam to get their specific time for the exam that day
(0900, 0930, 1000, 1030, and so on). Candidates can choose their times
in the sequence they appear in the <a href="exam.html" target="_self">list of candidates</a>.

<h2>Problem 3: 1D finite elements for a wave equation <a name="exam:H14:1DtFEM"></a></h2>

<p>
We address a 1D wave equation problem

$$
\begin{align*}
u_t &= c^2 u_{xx},\quad x\in (0,L)\\
u(0,t) &= 0\\
u_x(L,t)&= 0\\
u(x,0) &= I(x)\\
u_t(x,0) &= 0
\end{align*}
$$


<p>
<b>a)</b>
Use a finite difference method in time and a Galerkin method in space.
Derive the system of equations to be solved at each time level.

<p>
<b>b)</b>
Use P1 finite elements for the spatial discretization. Set up the
element matrices for the various terms in the variational formulation.
Set up the assembled linear system and express it in finite difference
operator notation. Comment upon the differences from a pure
finite difference method for this wave equation problem.

<p>
<b>c)</b>
Explain what kind of artifacts that can appear in a pure finite difference
solution of this wave equation problem (keep boundary conditions out of the discussion).

<p>
<!-- --- begin hint in exercise --- -->

<p>
<b>Hint.</b>
A wave entering a medium with a different (constant) wave velocity
is an example on a kind of physical problem that may trigger
numerical artifacts. Below is a wave that enters a medium with
1/4 of the wave velocity (more precisely, the Courant number jumps
from 1 to 0.25). The propagation of waves in the left
medium is exact, while the propagation in the other medium is
subject to numerical errors.

<b>d)</b>

\( \tilde c/c \), where \( \tilde c \) is the numerical wave velocity and \( c \)
is the exact velocity,
when we use P1 elements for the spatial discretization. Compare
in a plot this expression with the one we have in a pure finite
difference method. Comment on accuracy and stability for the
finite difference versus the finite element method.

<h2>Problem 4: Finite differences for a nonlinear PDE <a name="exam:H14:nonlin:FDM"></a></h2>

<p>
We look at a nonlinear diffusion problem

$$
\begin{align*}
\varrho(u)u_t &= \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(\alpha(u)\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}\right),\quad x\in (0,1)\\
u(0,t) &= 0\\
u(1,t) &= 0\\
u(x,0) &= I(x)
\end{align*}
$$

Here, \( \varrho(u) \) and \( \alpha(u) \) are possibly nonlinear functions of \( u \).

<p>
<b>a)</b>
Formulate a Picard iteration method for linearizing the PDE directly
(prior to any discretization).

<p>
<b>b)</b>
Formulate a Newton method for linearizing the PDE directly
(prior to any discretization).

<p>
<b>c)</b>
Discretize the original nonlinear problem by a backward difference
in time and a centered difference in space.

<p>
<b>d)</b>
Show that it does not matter whether we use Picard iteration first on
the PDE problem and then discretize by finite differences, or if we first
discretize by finite differences and then use Picard iteration for
the resulting system of nonlinear equations.

<p>
<b>e)</b>
Is the equivalence result in d) true if we use a Newton method? Explain
in detal.

<h2>Problem 5: A Galerkin method for spatial discretization of a nonlinear PDE <a name="exam:H14:nonlin:FEM"></a></h2>

<p>
We address the same nonlinear diffusion problem as in the previous problem.

<p>
<b>a)</b>
Use a Galerkin method for discretizing in space and a backward finite
difference in time. Derive the resulting system of nonlinear equations
to be solved at each time level.
Use Picard iteration to linearize the system.

<p>
<b>b)</b>
Use Picard iteration to linearize the PDE problem. Then use a backward
finite difference in time and a Galerkin method in space. Show that
the resulting linear systems to be solevd at each time
level is the same as in a).

<p>
<b>c)</b>
Use the method in a), but apply Newton's method to linearize the
equations. Derive expressions for the Jacobian and explain
how it and the right-hand side arising in Newton's method can be
computed.

<p>
<b>d)</b>
Use a Newton method to linearize the PDE problem directly. Then
discretize in time by a backward difference and in space by a
Galerkin method. Compare the linear system to be solved in each
Newton iteration with the one derived in the previous subexercise.

<p>
<b>e)</b>
Set up the expression for the Jacobian in Newton's method when
\( \varrho(u)=1+u^2 \) and \( \alpha(u) = |u_x|^m \) for a real number \( m \).

<p>
<!-- --- end exercise --- -->

<h2>Problem 6: A nonlinear ODE <a name="exam:H14:ODE"></a></h2>

<p>
The (scaled) velocity of a body falling in a fluid is governed by the
following equation:

$$ v'(t) = -\beta |v|v - 1,\quad v(0)=0$$

The velocity \( v(t) \) is positive upwards.

<p>
<b>a)</b>
Explain how this model arises from physical principles.

<p>
<b>b)</b>
Formulate a Forward Euler method, a Backward Euler method, and a
Crank-Nicolson method. Linearize the Backward Euler method by
using the previous time step in the factor \( |v| \). Interpret this
approach as a Picard iteration method. Linearize
the Crank-Nicolson method by using a geometric mean for the
nonlinear term \( |v|v \).

<p>
<b>c)</b>
Show plots or sketch the solution corresponding to \( \beta = 1 \)
and \( \Delta t=0.5, 1.1 \).

<p>
<b>d)</b>
To analyze the behavior of the schemes, we need a linear difference
equation. The &quot;worst case&quot; corresponds to the highest possible
velocity. Find this velocity and call it \( v_T \) (for terminal velocity
as \( t\rightarrow\infty \)). The worst case version of the ODE for analysis
can then be taken as

$$ v' = -\beta |v_T| v - 1$$

Seek symbolic,
exact solutions \( v^n=b(A^n-1) \) of the difference schemes, where \( b \) and \( A \)
are coefficients to be determined (\( v^0=0 \) as it should), and \( n \) is a
time level counter. Use the
exact solution of the difference equations
to explain what can go wrong with the schemes.
